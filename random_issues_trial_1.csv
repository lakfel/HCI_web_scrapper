10.1016/j.sigpro.2023.109018,A framework for millimeter-wave multi-user SLAM and its low-cost realization,"Millimeter-wave (mmWave) is regarded as a promising technique for accurate simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). However, the implementation of a massive antenna array and the extensiveness of mmWave anchor deployment significantly increase the cost of the whole system, and thus mmWave is still not considered in commercial localization scenarios. In this paper, a low-cost and highly efficient mmWave-based SLAM scheme is proposed to address the above limitations. Concretely, mmWave-based sensing is leveraged to obtain the locations of obstacles. Then, multi-user landmark association and fast map merging are performed for accurate global map construction. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves submeter-level mapping accuracy and provides new insight into efficiently designing a SLAM system that meets the stated requirements.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'multi-user'}","{'ar': 1, 'multi-user': 1}",
10.1016/j.neucom.2023.126697,A Review-based Feature-level Information Aggregation Model for Graph Collaborative Filtering,"To explicitly exploit the collaborative signals in the user-item interaction graph, a growing number of recent Collaborative Filtering (CF) studies adopt Graph Convolution Network (GCN) as a basis. Though effective, these methods basically treat all neighbors equally, ignoring the fact that neighbors should be target-related. While there are some works that assign different weights to neighbors via using the attention mechanism, they still suffer from two problems. First, the performance of them is limited by the lack of fine-grained details. Second, attention learned solely from interaction data may not reflect the user’s opinions accurately. To address these issues, we propose a Review-based Feature-level Information Aggregation (RFIA) graph model that incorporates the review information into the graph propagation to achieve more fine-grained information aggregation. The main idea of RFIA is to assign feature-level attention vectors for the interaction edges to adaptively adjust the contribution ratios of input neighbors across various dimensions, based on rich review information. Specifically, we first extract review features from text by BERT-Whitening. Then, we design non-linear feature extractors separately in two directions to further extract and refine these review features as feature-level attention. Finally, we design a graph contrastive learning module to optimize the learning of extractors under limited user behaviors. Experiments on three publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness and performance superiority of our proposed model.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

We propose a tactical human-vehicle collaboration framework by leveraging the hand-landmark extraction algorithm and the augmented reality visual feedback. The proposed vision-based interface projects the gesture, as the driver’s intention, onto the ground and feeds the projection back to the driver through the AR-HUD interface. The projected intention functions as a strategic decision or planning suggestion to the vehicle while collision avoidance, traffic rules compliance, and precise control are realized by the automation algorithm. The feasibility of the framework is validated through an integrated self-driving algorithm combining the risk field, learning-based trajectory prediction, and model predictive control.

This paper aims to study the interaction and integration problem between EVs and grid for the digital V2G platform, so as to support load aggregators making scheduling decisions. According to the variable-scale data analysis theory, a space–time scale space model is established to describe the demand response behavioral feature of EV users, and the lightning-Scale Transformation method (LST) is also proposed. Compared to the original unidirectional scale transformation modes, the LST is capable of adjusting the space and time observation scale collaboratively. A vehicle-to-grid scheduling method based on the lightning-Scale Transformation (V2G-LST) is put forward, in order to make scheduling plans by considering EV users’ behavioral feature and charger resource constraints. We collect the real dataset from 863 Beijing charging stations using the APIs of Amap, as well as the investigation data of the State Grid Corporation of China to verify the efficacy of our proposed method. Comparative experimental results verify that the V2G-LST could obtain the lower dispatch cost and higher EV charger usage rate than the maximum dispatchable quantity first method EVC-MDQ under both charging and discharging scenarios.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

However, single feature detection does not fully explore the PU information. Meanwhile, non-Gaussian interference will also affect the spectrum sensing performance. In this paper, we propose a novel spectrum sensing method using multimodal fusion and convolutional neural networks (CNN). First, the received signal at multiple antennas is preprocessed, where the generalized covariance matrix and the generalized Wigner-Ville distribution are used to characterize two different modes of the received signals as the input of CNN. Then, a CNN model using multimodal fusion is constructed. In this model, the attention mechanism is first used to extract features of different modalities, and the multimodal fusion technique fuses the extracted features to obtain the feature vector. Finally, the detection statistics and detection thresholds for spectrum sensing are constructed and compared using the output feature vectors of CNN. Simulation results show that the performance of multi-mode fusion spectrum sensing is better than the single-mode counterpart. This method can effectively realize spectrum sensing with both Gaussian noise and non-Gaussian interference, and it has a high detection probability at low SNR.",1,1,1,{'ar'},{'ar': 1},

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of HTML5 graphics and image processing and co-rendering technologies and to verify the effectiveness and usefulness of these technologies, including the measurement of user experience and efficiency. The simulation analysis is carried out on MATLAB, and different image compression algorithms are used for comparison. The evaluation indexes include peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM). Comparing the two methods of Joint Image Expert Group (JPEG) and fractal Image Compressed file (IFS), the results showed that the proposed algorithm provided better PSNR and SSIM values than IFS, and provided higher PSNR and lower SSIM values than JPEG under the condition of increasing compression ratio, showing excellent image processing and compression efficiency. Then, the correlation loss, brightness distortion, contrast distortion, and color distortion of image processing are analyzed for the four real scenes of blur, illumination, cloud, and strong light. The results showed that compared with JPEG and IFS, the correlation loss of the proposed algorithm was 15.46, 16.25, 16.78, and 17.45, respectively.

10.1109/CVPR52688.2022.00171,Collaborative Learning for Hand and Object Reconstruction with Attention-guided Graph Convolution,"Estimating the pose and shape of hands and objects under interaction finds numerous applications including aug-mented and virtual reality. Existing approaches for hand and object reconstruction require explicitly defined physical constraints and known objects, which limits its application domains. Our algorithm is agnostic to object models, and it learns the physical rules governing hand-object interaction. This requires automatically inferring the shapes and physi-cal interaction of hands and (potentially unknown) objects. We seek to approach this challenging problem by proposing a collaborative learning strategy where two-branches of deep networks are learning from each other. Specifically, we transfer hand mesh information to the object branch and vice versa for the hand branch. The resulting optimi-sation (training) problem can be unstable, and we address this via two strategies: (i) attention-guided graph convo-lution which helps identify and focus on mutual occlusion and (ii) unsupervised associative loss which facilitates the transfer of information between the branches. Experiments using four widely-used benchmarks show that our frame-work achieves beyond state-of-the-art accuracy in 3D pose estimation, as well as recovers dense 3D hand and object shapes.

Inspired by traditional steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP), technologies that combine SSVEP with AR are rapidly developing. In the existing studies on AR-SSVEP, the visual stimuli in AR are completely separated from the target object, while the SSVEP stimuli are always 2D graphics, which greatly limits the practical applications in real dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel AR-based visual stimulus scheme that uses a depth camera to obtain the position information of the target object in the displayed scene, and then completely overlaps the visual stimulus of SSVEP with the target object. The subject wearing the AR headset can move his head or walk in the AR scene, while the 3D position of the stimulus always overlaps the target object to avoid the effect of head shaking. Moreover, subjects can observe the 3D stimulus from different angles. We designed experiments comparing 2D stimuli with 3D stimuli from different angles in this paper to demonstrate the superiority of 3D stimuli in an AR environment. In addition to this, we used a user study to evaluate subjects’ experience with the AR-SSVEP stimulus paradigm in this paper and confirmed that the AR-SSVEP system with 3D stimulus overlapping with the target object has a better interaction experience.",2,1,2,"{'augmented reality', 'ar'}","{'augmented reality': 1, 'ar': 1}",

The performance of the considered framework is analyzed for the modified scheduling schemes in terms of error probability and average rate. Next, the closed-form expressions for the symbol error probability (SEP) and average rate are derived for independent and non-identically distributed Rayleigh fading channels. Also, the numerical analysis highlighting the impact of user mobility and imperfect channel estimation on the scheduling strategies, fairness is presented.

Design, being an innovation-driven domain, demands greater flexibility in resource allocation. Consequently, rapidly and effectively allocating cloud service resources for personalized design tasks becomes crucial. With the emergence of the Industrial Metaverse, which blurs the boundaries between real and virtual design and manufacturing, it is gaining increasing attention. To embrace the advent of Industry 5.0 and the Industrial Metaverse, swift collaborative cloud services for design and manufacturing resources are essential. In this context, this article introduces a novel approach combining complex networks with the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III), aimed at rapidly optimizing the dynamic allocation of distributed design resources (DRs). Initially, a multipartite graph is created from raw data and mapped to multiple bipartite graphs to identify key nodes in the network through intersection. Subsequently, these key nodes are used as reference points in the NSGA-III algorithm to achieve high-quality cloud service combinations, meeting the needs of design tasks with multiple subtasks, and related multi-objective optimization, including time, cost, reliability, maintainability, and reputation associated with the design. Finally, the Pareto service combinations obtained are used to construct a new complex network and employ the Girvan-Newman algorithm based on edge betweenness to identify community structures. In case of anomalies in the best service combination, alternative options can be swiftly searched from the identified communities, thereby enhancing the resilience of the cloud service process. Experimental results demonstrate the method's advantages in recovery and robustness, contributing significantly to the optimization of rapid cloud service allocation for DRs in the context of Industry 5.0.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

To bridge the gap, a novel digital twin-enabled MCD approach is proposed. Firstly, the paper explores how to converge the MCD into the digital design process of complex engineering products in a cyber-physical system manner. The multidisciplinary collaborative design is divided into three parts: multidisciplinary knowledge collaboration, multidisciplinary collaborative modeling and multidisciplinary collaborative simulation, and the realization methods are proposed for each part. To be able to describe the complex product in a virtual environment, a systematic MCD framework based on the digital twin is further constructed. Integrate multidisciplinary collaboration into three stages: conceptual design, detailed design and virtual verification. The ability to verify and revise problems arising from multidisciplinary fusions in real-time minimizes the number of iterations and costs in the design process.

Simultaneously, it must be acknowledged that the check-in and trajectory information of the user is absolutely disclosed to others in location-based social networks when recommending the next POIs. Therefore, how to achieve an accurate next POI recommendation on the premise of privacy preservation is a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we propose decentralized user preference learning for privacy-preserving next POI recommendation, called NRDL. First, to capture the user’s next POI preference, we model the user’s real-time demand representation by POI profile, POI category, absolute time, transition time and distance between previously visited POIs, which is input into an attention-based recurrent neural network (RNN) model for embedding. Second, to perform privacy preservation, we develop a decentralized learning framework that can achieve user preference learning by raw data on each user’s side. Learning on each user’s side can make the privacy data of the user not be revealed to platforms or others, and learning from raw data can guarantee the value of check-ins and further accuracy.

EMRs contain complex relationships between patients and treatment patterns. Recent studies have shown that graph neural collaborative filtering can effectively capture the complex relationships in EMRs. However, none of the existing methods take into account the impact of medical content such as the patient’s admission diagnosis, and medical history on treatment recommendations. In this work, we propose a graph neural collaborative filtering model with medical content-aware pre-training (CAPRec) for learning initial embeddings with medical content to improve recommendation performance. First the model constructs a patient-treatment pattern interaction graph from EMRs data. Then we attempt to use the medical content for pre-training learning and transfer the learned embeddings to a graph neural collaborative filtering model. Finally, the learned initial embedding can support the downstream task of graph collaborative filtering.

Virtual Reality (VR) can support resilience as it allows for embodied experiences and experiential learning. We present the design and initial user evaluation of an immersive VR experience for strengthening resilience, inspired by Viktor Frankl’s psychotherapy, ‘logotherapy and existential analysis’ (LTEA). The prototype immerses users in two experiences related to guilt or suffering and guides them through an interactive reflection, encouraging them to consider their potential for finding meaning even in adverse circumstances. Although the self-reported resilience measures did not indicate increased resilience, qualitative data suggest that the users were able to use the prototype to reflect on meaning in life.

As such, we incorporate users' successful viewing probabilities into our scheduling design and develop a scheduling algorithm that not only asymptotically achieves the optimal application-level throughput but also provides service regularity guarantees.

However, it is unknown if psychological treatments for depression improve BDNF and if change in BDNF is a mediator of intervention effects on depressive symptoms. Therefore, using data from the eIMPACT trial, we sought to determine the effect of modernized collaborative care for depression on 12-month changes in BDNF and cognitive/affective and somatic depressive symptom clusters and to examine whether BDNF changes mediate intervention effects on depressive symptoms. 216 primary care patients with depression from a safety net healthcare system were randomized to 12 months of the eIMPACT intervention (internet cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT], telephonic CBT, and select antidepressant medications) or usual primary care. Plasma BDNF was measured with commercially available kits, and depressive symptom clusters were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The intervention did not influence BDNF but did improve both the cognitive/affective and somatic clusters over 12 months. Changes in BDNF did not mediate the intervention effect on either cluster. Our findings suggest that modernized collaborative care is an effective treatment for both the cognitive/affective and somatic symptoms of depression and that the mechanism of action is not improvements in BDNF.

10.1016/j.jag.2024.103877,A strategy for tracing interactions in online collaborative geographic experiments,"Online collaborative geographic experiments have many advantages in communication, resource sharing, and task coordination; thus, they play a vital role in comprehensive geographic problem solving for interdisciplinary experts. In these collaborative experiments, different experts usually possess different knowledge backgrounds and are responsible for specific tasks, making it difficult to fully understand the entire experimental process and implementation details, which may lead to different experimental ideas and actions, thus reducing the efficiency of the experiment. Therefore, it is necessary to record and trace information to help participants reach a consensus on the understanding of the experiment to support collaboration. However, most of the existing tracing strategies focus on the states of geographic experimental data but ignore the different interactions that impact the generation, flow, and use of these data. Limitations remain for existing strategies in terms of providing comprehensive insight into the geographic experiment process and its implementation details, especially when addressing the requirements of process understanding, error localization, and scheme sharing. Therefore, this study presents a strategy for tracing interactions in online collaborative geographic experiments. This strategy focuses on interactions and their types, structures, and dependencies during the geographic experiment process; designs three components for recording interaction information; and uses corresponding extraction methods to trace interaction information. To verify the feasibility of this strategy, it was implemented in an online prototype system, and a case study of aboveground forest biomass prediction under climate change was conducted with the prototype system. The results indicate that the proposed strategy can help enhance collaboration among different participants, thus effectively improving the performance of collaborative geographic experiments.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

This study adopted multiple mathematic models and data mining technologies, including Moran's I (MI), the self-organizing map (SOM), the distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM), multivariate meta-analysis, and univariable multivariate meta-regression, and aimed to explore the spatio-temporal trends and influencing mechanisms of PM2.5 and O3 in different regions. Results revealed that PM2.5 and O3 showed nonlinear and lagged associations with meteorology and precursors and relatively large spatial heterogeneity existed in the influencing mechanisms. The eight clusters, divided with SOM based on air pollution, can explain a substantial part of spatial heterogeneity in influencing mechanisms, which means influencing mechanisms are more consistent in regions with similar pollution characteristics. PM2.5 and O3 heavily polluted regions showed strong SAE according to Moran's I index (LMI), and showed sensitive responses to meteorology and precursors according to meta-analysis of DLNM. Results also suggested that simultaneously mitigating PM2.5 and O3 showed a promising long-term prospect, and that NOx reduction should be strengthened in PM2.5 dominated months and lightened in O3 dominated months at current O3-NOx-VOC regime.

However, most studies tend to overlook the impact of high-order data outside the sequence and its corresponding position information on users' interest, especially fail to maximize the collaborative signals between users or items. To alleviate the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel sequential recommendation model, called GNSR, which utilizes graph structures at various levels to enhance the node representation and ultimately improve recommendation performance. Specifically, we construct a high-dimensional continuous-time bipartite graph centered on target users and their historical sequences while preserving the interaction order. Subsequently, we create meta-path graphs through meta-path exploration. Additionally, to capture both effective high-dimensional collaborative signals and dynamic changes in users' interests throughout the sequence, we design a High-Dimensional Information Collaboration Module within GNSR, which enables a comprehensive understanding of user behavior. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets and demonstrate that the performance of GNSR improves by approximately 0.1% ∼ 3.2% over selected baselines.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

Also, it integrates naturally in optimization problems such as maintenance planning and traffic management. We develop the model and apply it for the Sioux Falls network, showing that it outperforms the traditional Beckmann-based and MSA approaches in smaller-scale problems.

However, UDN makes network selection more challenging due to the densification of small cells in 5 G and their heterogeneity.

The proposed handover mechanism is context sensitive and it adapts to changing network conditions, ensuring efficient handovers during high-speed vehicular movement. Furthermore, the mechanism incorporates the concept of small cell Stay Time, which may reduce unnecessary handovers.

However, current literature does not demonstrate a clear superiority between ACDF and CDA. PurposeTo investigate procedural and patient-reported outcomes of ACDF and CDA among patients included in the Michigan Spine Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MSSIC) database. DesignRetrospective study of prospectively collected outcomes registry data. Patient SampleIndividuals within the MSSIC database presenting with radiculopathy, myelopathy, or cervical spondylosis refractory to typical conservative care undergoing primary ACDF or CDA from January 4, 2016, to November 5, 2021. Outcome MeasuresPerioperative measures (including surgery length, length of stay, return to OR, any complications), patient-reported functional outcomes at 2-year follow-up (including return to work, patient satisfaction, PROMIS, EQ-5D, mJOA). MethodsPatients undergoing ACDF were matched 4:1 with those undergoing CDA; propensity analysis performed on operative levels (1- and 2- level procedures), presenting condition, demographics, and comorbidities. Initial comparisons performed with univariate testing and multivariate analysis performed with Poisson generalized estimating equation models clustering on hospital. ResultsA total of 2,208 patients with ACDF and 552 patients with CDA were included. Baseline demographics were similar, with younger patients undergoing CDA (45.6 vs 48.6 years; p<.001). Myelopathy was more frequent in ACDF patients (30% vs 25%; p=.015). CDA was more frequently planned as an outpatient procedure. Length of stay was increased in ACDF (1.3 vs 1.0 days; p<.001). Functional outcomes were similar, with comparable proportions of patients meeting minimal clinically important difference thresholds in neck pain, arm pain, PROMIS, EQ-5D, and mJOA score. After multivariate regression, no significant differences were seen in surgical or functional outcomes. ConclusionsThis study demonstrates similar outcomes for those undergoing ACDF and CDA at 2 years. Previous meta-analyses of CDA clinical trial data adhere to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria required by clinical studies; this registry data provides “real world” clinical outcomes reflecting current practices for ACDF and CDA patient selection.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

The purpose of this study was to characterize the LS-SCLC fractionation regimens used throughout a statewide collaborative, analyze patient and treatment factors associated with these regimens, and describe real-world acute toxicity profiles of once- and twice-daily radiation therapy (RT) regimens. Methods and MaterialsDemographic, clinical, and treatment data along with physician-assessed toxicity and patient-reported outcomes were prospectively collected by 29 institutions within the Michigan Radiation Oncology Quality Consortium between 2012 and 2021 for patients with LS-SCLC. We modeled the influence of RT fractionation and other patient-level variables clustered by treatment site on the odds of a treatment break specifically due to toxicity with multilevel logistic regression. National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0, incident grade 2 or worse toxicity was longitudinally compared between regimens. ResultsThere were 78 patients (15.6% overall) treated with twice-daily RT and 421 patients treated with once-daily RT. Patients receiving twice-daily RT were more likely to be married or living with someone (65% vs 51%; P = .019) and to have no major comorbidities (24% vs 10%; P = .017). Once-daily RT fractionation toxicity peaked during RT, and twice-daily toxicity peaked within 1 month after RT. After stratifying by treatment site and adjusting for patient-level variables, once-daily treated patients had 4.11 (95% confidence interval, 1.31-12.87) higher odds of treatment break specifically due to toxicity than twice-daily treated patients. ConclusionsHyperfractionation for LS-SCLC remains infrequently prescribed despite the lack of evidence demonstrating superior efficacy or lower toxicity of once-daily RT. With peak acute toxicity after RT and lower likelihood of a treatment break with twice-daily fractionation in real-word practice, providers may start using hyperfractionated RT more frequently.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

The data from medical imaging devices, such as CT and MRI scanners, consist of stacks of 2D images in DICOM format. Conversely, advances in 3D data visualization provide further information by assembling cross-sections into 3D volumetric datasets. As Microsoft unveiled the HoloLens 2 (HL2), which is considered one of the best Mixed Reality (XR) headsets in the market, it promised to enhance visualization in 3D by providing an immersive experience to users. This paper introduces a prototype holographic XR DICOM Viewer for the 3D visualization of DICOM image sets on HL2 for surgical planning. We first developed a standalone graphical C++ engine using the native DirectX11 API and HLSL shaders. Based on that, the prototype further applies the OpenXR API for potential deployment on a wide range of devices from vendors across the XR spectrum. With native access to the device, our prototype unravels the limitation of hardware capabilities on HL2 for 3D volume rendering and interaction. Moreover, smartphones can act as input devices to provide another user interaction method by connecting to our server. In this paper, we present a holographic DICOM viewer for the HoloLens 2 and contribute (i) a prototype that renders the DICOM image stacks in real-time on HL2, (ii) three types of user interactions in XR, and (iii) a preliminary qualitative evaluation of our prototype.",5,2,5,"{'mixed reality', 'multi-user', 'xr', 'augmented reality', 'ar'}","{'augmented reality': 1, 'ar': 1, 'mixed reality': 1, 'xr': 1, 'multi-user': 1}",

Creating an immersive experience for online meetings is a necessity towards more diverse and seamless environments. Efficient photorealistic rendering of human 3D dynamics is the core of immersive meetings. Current popular applications achieve real-time conferencing but fall short in delivering photorealistic human dynamics, either due to limited 2D space or the use of avatars that lack realistic interactions between participants. Recent advances in neural rendering, such as the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), offer the potential for greater realism in metaverse meetings. However, the slow rendering speed of NeRF poses challenges for real-time conferencing. We envision a pipeline for a future extended reality metaverse conferencing system that leverages monocular video acquisition and free-viewpoint synthesis to enhance data and hardware efficiency. Towards an immersive conferencing experience, we explore an accelerated NeRF-based free-viewpoint synthesis algorithm for rendering photorealistic human dynamics more efficiently. We show that our algorithm achieves comparable rendering quality while performing training and inference 44.5% and 213% faster than state-of-the-art methods, respectively.

As the most rapidly expanding segment within the food industry, aquaculture presents a sustainable solution to mitigate the overexploitation of marine resources and address the growing demand for food. Aquaculture's sufficient aquatic expanses offer considerable potential for PV deployment, thereby relieving the demand for limited land resources. However, existing research rarely addresses the collaborative operation of water and electricity in aquaculture systems. The effects of water evaporation from PV panel-covered water surfaces on the collaborative water-electricity operation are generally neglected. Hence, this work proposes a collaborative water-electricity operation of a photovoltaic (PV)-pumped storage-based aquaculture energy system considering the water evaporation effects. This optimization method accounts for the reduced water evaporation due to PV panel shading. Water surface PV and pumped storage are integrated into the system to fulfill electricity needs, with pumped storage serving as a dual-purpose device for water and electricity supply. Environmentally sustainable water-electricity generation and aquaculture energy system requirements are established. Water surface PV electricity generation is modeled based on climate and engineering conditions, while aquaculture pond electricity requirement includes oxygenation, feeding, and water replenishment. Finally, a collaborative water-electricity operation model is introduced to optimize operation strategies for various devices. A case study on a fish-light complementation project demonstrates that this optimization method can reduce reliance on the utility grid and overall system operational costs.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

Tabletops with an embedded display are generally less flexible and more fragile than ordinary massive tabletops. Physical objects on the tabletop occlude the digital content. In contrast, top-down-projected interfaces using an overhead projector-camera system allow for augmenting arbitrary tables and objects lying on them. However, detecting pointing input only via a camera image captured from above requires robustly recognizing whether a finger or pen touches the tabletop or whether it hovers slightly above it. In this demonstration, we showcase a solution for reliably tracking a pen on arbitrary tabletop surfaces. The pen emits infrared light via a tip made of optical fiber. A camera captures position and shape of the light point on the surface. Our open-source tracking algorithm combines heuristics and a neural network to distinguish between drawing and hovering.

ObjectiveThis paper presents the results of a systematic literature review (SLR) focused on the analysis of current proposals exploiting the synergies of DTs and MAS. This research aims to synthesize studies that focus on the use of MAS to support DTs development and MAS that exploit DTs, paving the way for future research. MethodA SLR methodology was used to conduct a detailed study analysis of 64 primary studies out of a total of 220 studies that were initially identified. This SLR analyses three research questions related to the synergies between MAS and DT. ResultsThe most relevant findings of this SLR and their implications for further research are the following: i) most of the analyzed proposals design digital shadows rather than DT; ii) they do not fully support the properties expected from a DT; iii) most of the MAS properties have not fully exploited for the development of DT; iv) ontologies are frequently used for specifying semantic models of the physical twin. ConclusionsBased on the results of this SLR, our conclusions for the community are presented in a research agenda that highlights the need of innovative theoretical proposals and design frameworks that guide the development of DT.

However, over-smoothing has always hindered GNNs from going deeper and capturing multi-hop neighbors. Meanwhile, most methods follow a semi-supervised learning manner, the label scarcity would limit their applicability in real-world systems. Unlike GNNs, Transformers can model global information and multi-hop interactions via multi-head self-attention and a proper Transformer structure can show more immunity to over-smoothing. So, can we propose a novel framework to combine GNN and Transformer, integrating both GNN’s local information aggregation and Transformer’s global information modeling ability to eliminate the over-smoothing problem and achieve self-supervised graph representation? To realize this, this paper proposes a collaborative learning scheme for GNN-Transformer and constructs GTC architecture. GTC leverages the GNN and Transformer branch to encode node information from different views respectively, and establishes contrastive learning tasks based on the encoded cross-view information to realize self-supervised heterogeneous graph representation. For the Transformer branch, we propose Metapath-aware Hop2Token and CG-Hetphormer, which can cooperate with GNNs to attentively encode neighborhood information from different levels. As far as we know, this is the first attempt in the field of graph representation learning to utilize both GNNs and Transformer to collaboratively capture different view information and conduct cross-view contrastive learning.

10.1016/j.eswa.2023.120963,HKGCL: Hierarchical graph contrastive learning for multi-domain recommendation over knowledge graph,"Multi-domain recommendation (MDR) aims to improve the recommendation performance in all target domains simultaneously by leveraging rich data from relevant domains. However, conventional approaches either only rely on sparse interactions in each separate scenario, or simply combine multiple shared recommendation solutions, resulting in MDR systems still suffering from severely low recommendation accuracy. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel recommendation model called Hierarchical Graph Contrastive Learning for Multi-Domain Recommendation over Knowledge Graph (HKGCL). Different from previous MDR models, our HKGCL can treat each relevant domain as a hierarchy in the interaction network. Based on the LightGCN aggregation strategy, a hierarchical message passing mechanism over the knowledge graph is designed to aggregate hierarchical knowledge representations for users and items. Then, a hierarchical node dropping scheme is proposed as our data augmentation technique on different hierarchical views to obtain more self-supervised semantic signals.

However, the cross-reactivity of antisera against the two lineages of the influenza B virus (IFVB) may cause inaccurate quantification of HA content in QIVs using the SRID assay. To examine cross-reactivity and develop an appropriate procedure for accurate measurement of vaccine potency, a collaborative study with four Japanese vaccine manufacturers was conducted to measure the HA contents of trivalent influenza vaccines (TIVs) and QIVs by SRID assay with a single and a mixture of reference antigens (refAgs) from each lineage of IFVB for seven influenza seasons from 2015/16 to 2021/22. The cross-reactivity of the two IFVB components in the SRID assay varied depending on the vaccine viruses.

The current study investigated the potentials and possible constraints of VR-assisted interpreting teaching in universities by comparing students’ performance in VR-assisted and traditional face-to-face teaching modes respectively. This study adopts a competence-based approach and uses mainly quantitative methods by selecting twenty undergraduates and randomly dividing them into two groups, namely experimental group (adopting VR assisted training mode) and control group (adopting face-to-face training mode), in dialogue interpreting training. This study evaluates students’ interpreting quality in terms of product (i.e. accuracy and adequacy) and service (i.e. equivalency and interaction). In addition, the experimental group students are required to complete a post-test questionnaire measuring student's perception, acceptance and evaluation of VR-assisted training mode. The author concludes that VR-assisted training mode does not notably improve students’ interpreting product quality, however, it excels face-to-face training mode in improving student's interpreting service quality by strengthening their interactive and self-evaluation capabilities, and most importantly stimulating their interests in interpreting learning. This study also proposes a hybrid training mode by incorporating VR tools into traditional training mode.

Considering the uncertainty of the connection relationship between parts of end-of-life products, a partial destructive disassembly mode based on the disassembly feasibility is introduced. In this study, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model of disassembly line balancing and sequence planning (DLBSP) is constructed. The aim is to minimize the number of stations, smoothness index, and energy consumption, and maximize the disassembly profit simultaneously. To obtain high-quality disassembly schemes, a multi-objective improved genetic algorithm is proposed. An encoding and decoding strategy based on problem characteristics is designed to improve the quality of the initial solutions. The feasibility of crossover and mutation operations is ensured by introducing precedence constraints, and a single-point insertion neighborhood strategy is designed to improve the local search ability of the algorithm. Then, the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm is verified in a small-scale case, and the performance of the proposed algorithm is better than that of nine meta-heuristics through 22 test cases. Next, the proposed model and algorithm are applied to a real CRT TV disassembly case. It is shown that the new disassembly scheme can reduce two stations, improve smoothness by 99.83%, increase profits by 89.75%, and reduce energy consumption by 24.66% compared to the original scheme.

The total communication costs of federated learning is related to the number of communication rounds, the communication consumption of each participants, the setting of reasonable learning rate and the guarantee of calculation fairness. In addition, the isolating data strategy in the federated learning framework cannot completely guarantee the privacy security of users. Motivated by the above problems, this paper proposes a federated learning scheme combined with the adaptive gradient descent strategy and differential privacy mechanism, which is suitable for multi-party collaborative modeling scenarios. To ensure that federated learning scheme can train efficiently with limited communications costs, the adaptive learning rate algorithm is innovatively used to adjust the gradient descent process and avoid the model overfitting and fluctuation phenomena, so as to improve the modeling efficiency and performance in multi-party calculation scenarios. Furthermore, in order to adapt to the ultra-large-scale distributed secure computing scenario, this research introduces differential privacy mechanism to resist various background knowledge attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive federated learning model performs better than the traditional models under fixed communication costs.

Social recommender systems leverage social relations among users to predict their preferences. Recently, graph neural networks have been utilized for social recommendations, modeling user-user social relations and user–item interactions as graph-structured data. Despite their improvement over traditional systems, most existing social recommender systems exploit only first-order social relations and overlook the importance of social influence diffusion from higher-order neighbors in social networks. Additionally, these techniques often treat all neighboring nodes equally, without highlighting the most influential ones. To address these challenges, we introduce GATE-SR, a novel model that leverages a multi-head graph attention autoencoder to capture indirect social influence from higher-order neighbors while emphasizing the most relevant users. Moreover, we incorporate implicit social connections derived from coherent communities within the network. While GATE-SR performs comparably to baseline models in rich data environments, its strength lies in excelling at cold-start scenarios—where other models often fall short. This focus on cold-start performance aligns with our goal of building a robust recommender system for real-world challenges. Through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that GATE-SR outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines in cold-start scenarios.

However, existing studies face two typical challenges: 1) how to dynamically evaluate workers’ individual abilities and collaborative contributions to the team; 2) how to select unknown workers to form a team with high quality at low cost. To tackle the above challenges, this paper proposes an Integration of Individual and Collaborative Abilities based Dynamic Worker Selection (IICA-DWS) algorithm to recruit excellent workers as a team in a high-quality and low-cost style. In the IICA-DWS algorithm, each worker’s individual ability and collaborative contribution to the team are evaluated more accurately using the Approximate Shapley Value (ASV). In addition, a high-quality team formation method is established to complete complex tasks at low cost. This involves the selection of both team leaders and team members. In this process, the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model is adopted to dynamically select excellent workers using exploration and exploitation phases. Lastly, the IICA-DWS algorithm is evaluated through theoretical analysis and experimental results. The results show that the IICA-DWS algorithm can improve the data quality of tasks by 47.3% and reduce the cost by 61.7% on average. Moreover, the IICA-DWS algorithm has a high probability of approximating optimal results, which shows the best performance among the comparative algorithms.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

Herein, a multifunctional nanoplatform (labelled as MPRD) based on molybdenum disulfide quantum dots (MoS2 QDs) is developed to achieve enhanced antitumor efficiency by integrating fluorescence imaging, tumor-targeting and synergistic chemo/photodynamic therapy (PDT) into one system. First, polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated MoS2 QDs (MP) with desirable stability are synthesized via a hydrothermal process using MoS2 QDs and carboxyamino-terminated oligomeric PEG as raw materials. Then, MP were conjugated with arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide via amidation to form a novel nanocarrier (MPR), which possesses strong blue fluorescence, good biocompatibility and ανβ3 receptor-mediated targeting ability. More importantly, MPR generated reactive oxygen species under 808 nm laser activation to realize targeted antitumor PDT. Further doxorubicin (DOX) was loaded onto MPR, which endows MPRD with localized chemotherapy and pH-responsive drug release. The MPRD exhibits improved chemotherapy performance on HepG2 cells (overexpressing integrin ανβ3) owing to enhanced cellular uptake mediated by ανβ3 receptor and effective drug release triggered by intracellular pH. Notably, MPRD with efficient tumor targeting ability and high chemo/PDT efficacy under NIR laser irradiation is capable of inhibiting HepG2 tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo, which is significantly superior to each individual therapy.

The energy-efficient train scheduling without combining with train circulation planning may inadvertently increase the other cost of rolling stocks, and finally lead to an increment of the total operation cost. This paper studies the integrated problem of energy-efficient train scheduling and train circulation planning for urban rail, and aims to reduce the total operation cost of rolling stocks including energy consumption. Its main challenge is to simultaneously solve three subproblems, namely the saving of train's traction energy in each rail section, the utilizing of regenerative braking energy and the optimizing of train circulation plan. We construct an optimization model to simultaneously optimize schedule and train circulation plan. Based on the designing of a strategy to create the train circulation plan for each train schedule, an efficient particle swarm algorithm is formed to solve our proposed model.

Baby2Home (B2H) is a digital intervention built on the collaborative care model (CCM) designed to support families during these transitions to parenthood. ObjectivesWe aim to investigate the effects of B2H on preventive healthcare utilization for the family unit and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) trajectories with a focus on mental health. We also aim to evaluate heterogeneity in treatment effects across social determinants of health including self-reported race and ethnicity and household income. We hypothesize that B2H will lead to optimized healthcare utilization, improved PROs trajectories, and reduced racial, ethnic, and income-based disparities in these outcomes as compared to usual care. MethodsB2H is a multi-center, pragmatic, individual-level randomized controlled trial. We will enroll 640 families who will be randomized to: [1] B2H + usual care, or [2] usual care alone.

The dynamic path planning problem from multiple sources to a single destination (DMS-SD) without prior knowledge about the target is proposed in this paper. The modified Dijkstra’s algorithm (Xiao et al., 2022) in the previous work can optimally address the DMS-SD problem, which effectively generates an optimal solution in the small map. However, it requires more than 60s to compute the result in our extensive map test, which is intolerable for real-time navigation users. Therefore, we have proposed a hybrid optimisation method to address the problem more efficiently in this paper. The proposed method integrates the Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and modifies the heuristic function to fit the hybrid algorithm. The pure MCTS algorithm can accelerate the randomised search by only exploring unvisited nodes, instead of generating every possible solution. More importantly, benefiting from limiting the maximum exploring depth, our method can approach an optimal point and generate a sub-optimal solution without any prior training used in other neural network-based methods. Experiment results show that our proposed algorithm demonstrates competitive performance with other existing state-of-the-art methods, such as reinforcement learning-based approaches, without training the neural network model.

This study investigated factors associated with PSMs following RP and determined their impact on clinical outcomes (BCR, second treatment [radiotherapy and/or androgen deprivation therapy], and prostate cancer-specific mortality [PCSM]). MethodsThe study cohort included men diagnosed with prostate cancer (pT2-3b/N0/M0) between January 1998 and June 2016 who underwent RP from the South Australian Prostate Cancer Clinical Outcomes Collaborative database. Factors associated with risk of PSMs were identified using Poisson regression. The impact of PSMs on clinical outcomes (BCR, second treatment, and PCSM) was assessed using competing risk regression. ResultsOf the 2827 eligible participants, 28% had PSMs—10% apical, 6% bladder neck, 17% posterolateral, and 5% at multiple locations. Median follow-up was 9.6 years with 81 deaths from prostate cancer recorded. Likelihood of PSM increased with higher pathological grade and pathological tumor stage, and greater tumour volume, but decreased with increasing surgeon volume (odds ratio [OR]: 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.88–0.98, per 100 previous prostatectomies).

Risk of BCR was increased similarly for each PSM location, but was higher for multiple margin sites. We found no association between PSMs and PCSM.

Somewhat surprisingly, very few works examine the impact of pilot spacing on the correlation structure of subsequent channel estimates and the resulting quality of channel state information considering channel aging. In this paper, we consider a fast-fading environment characterized by its exponentially decaying autocorrelation function, and model pilot spacing as a sampling problem to capture the inherent trade-off between the quality of channel state information and the number of symbols available for information carrying data symbols. We first establish a quasi-closed form for the achievable deterministic equivalent SINR when the channel estimation algorithm utilizes multiple pilot signals. Next, we establish upper bounds on the achievable SINR and spectral efficiency, as a function of pilot spacing, which helps to find the optimum pilot spacing within a limited search space. Our key insight is that to maximize the achievable SINR and the spectral efficiency of MU-MIMO systems, proper pilot spacing must be applied to control the impact of the aging channel and to tune the trade-off between pilot and data symbols.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'multiuser'}","{'ar': 1, 'multiuser': 1}",

Many approaches detected novel DDAs from heterogenous network which integrates similar drugs, similar diseases and the known DDAs. However, sparsity of the known DDAs and intrinsic synergic relations on representations of drugs and diseases in the heterogenous network are still the main challenges for DDAs prediction. Results:To address the problems, a novel drug repositioning approach is proposed here. Firstly, a drug similar network is constructed by Gaussian similarity kernel fusion of multisource drug similarities. Likewise, a disease similar network is generated by the same strategy. Secondly, the known DDAs network is extended by a bi-random walk algorithm from the above-mentioned similar networks. Meanwhile, representations of drugs and diseases are learned from their similar networks through graph convolutions and then a DDAs network is induced from the representations. Finally, to discover latent DDAs, the inductive DDAs network is refined iteratively by collaborating with the extended known DDAs network.

Furthermore, the combination of Trust Manager (TM) and Broker Manager (BM) components strengthens SLA control and trust evaluation, aligning smoothly with IaaS standards to improve service quality and reliability. User Profiling, which is classified into private, social, and corporate profiles, provides a separate lens for successful cloud user management inside the IaaS landscape, allowing for customised service delivery. SMI and cutting-edge ranking algorithms, such as the Deep Q-based Algorithm, optimize cloud service provider selection and ranking—an important aspect of IaaS. The use of the Banker's algorithm and a comprehensive Service Level Agreement (SLA) Management plan provides efficient resource allocation, mirroring recognized IaaS standards. This research study not only throws light on these trailblazing techniques, but it also establishes a new standard for IaaS cloud design and resource management.",1,1,1,{'ar'},{'ar': 1},

These shows took place in a virtual representation of a theater, leveraging the shared conventions of live theatrical performance to simplify the challenge of onboarding the audience: knowing how to behave in a real world theater translates intuitively to behavior in a virtual theater. At the same time, our production process mimicked that of real world theater, with very close parallels in the application of traditional theatrical skills and practices – with the main difference being that our cast and crew were all fully remote. Finally, the Hubs platform allows audiences to view the show on a range of hardware from VR HMDs to tablets and phones. Put together, our process represents a model by which independent theater companies can create productions using familiar techniques and skills, and present it for distributed audiences who don't have dedicated hardware. Ours was an approach of utilizing the latest virtualization technology to allow access to the widest range of audience possible, all from a bare-bones production budget. Unlike other approaches to virtual or online theater, the work of Jettison and its OnBoardXR is an attempt to, as closely as possible, replicate the experience of attending a show in a real world theater – an experience unavailable over the past year.

On the other hand, rapid technological advances presents both challenges and opportunities to the development agenda. Learning is ever-required in this continuously changing environment. In addition, the global nature of the environment today calls for virtual learning because of convenience, time and cost factors. This research seeks to draw measures to promote virtual learning experience. The research is based on a total virtual learning experience of a masters' level information and communication technology for development (ICT4D) 2.0 course comprised of students in South Africa, Myanmar, Finland and Germany at the University of Tampere. The research included how well the virtual environment and pedagogy promoted constructive, collaborative and conversational learning. In addition, how well the learners' needs, such as, active, reflective and intentional learning are incorporated. The research seeks to promote context in terms of assessing the learning environment, that is, students' virtual learning experience, study contents and learning technologies. Context should be embraced to map the learning process that suits the learners and study contents. The results of this study include highlighting pedagogical techniques and technological tools that fit the learners' and study content requirements to foster learning in a virtual environment. For example in this ICT4D 2.0 course, open learning diary, that is, online submission of students' diaries so that all the course's participants could review, was adopted to make learning more collaborative and conversional. Technological tools, such as, wiki and discussion form were also adopted to promote active and reflective learning in virtual environment.

Public transport (PT) service providers around the world are implementing integrated ticketing schemes to improve synergy and to remove or reduce the barriers to travelling across operators that are created by multimodal and deregulated public transport markets. Yet, users' preferences and WTP for integrated ticketing systems is mostly unexplored, leaving policymakers with little means of evaluating their potential economic benefits. Consequently, this case study was conducted to estimate PT users' WTP for multi-county and multi-operator integrated ticketing. Multinomial and mixed multinomial logit models were estimated using stated preference (SP) data, collected in relation to the Movingo multi-county and multi-operator integrated season ticket scheme in Mälardalen, Sweden. The findings showed strong evidence of users WTP for regional ticketing integration. Users' valuation of the integration is estimated to be at least 26% of the average integrated monthly ticket price. The mean WTP of non-commuting PT users' is estimated to be 42% higher than that of PT commuters. Women PT users showed less variability in their WTP compared to men. Still, the mean WTP of men is about twice as high as that of women. A higher proportion of men are willing to pay over 50% of the average integrated season ticket price to get the benefits of an intercounty integrated ticketing system. The resulting range of WTP values could be used in cost-benefit-analysis to infer policy conclusions about the value of integrated ticketing for users and society.",1,1,1,{'ar'},{'ar': 1},

An experimental system to realize and to confirm the effectiveness of the concept is constructed using tele-manipulation and augmented reality (AR) technologies. The experimental system is composed of a haptic device, an augmented reality monitor, a robot manipulator with hand in the end-effector for handling the fine part, a force sensor, some cameras, and a work jig. The effectiveness of the assembly process of fine parts using tele-manipulation and augmented reality is confirmed by some experiments. In the experiments, by adjusting the workspace in the operator side and the assembly area side using scaling factor in the motion command from haptic device to robot manipulator, and also reaction force occurred in the assembly area to haptic device, the assembly process can be conducted effectively. In addition, it is also confirmed that by putting some vector representations of motion command and force in the augmented reality monitor, it can assist human to conduct the assembly process.

However, it is challenging to have the EC servers gain security protections like those in centralized data centers, making them more vulnerable to security attacks, especially distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Existing detection approaches relying on the feedback from EC servers under the attacks can incur high bandwidth costs and service performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a new framework CoWatch for collaborative prediction and detection of DDoS Attacks in EC scenarios. Based on the distributed software-defined networking (SDN) architecture, CoWatch can collaboratively predict the DDoS attacks towards the EC servers and detect the attack flows in time. To efficiently filter the suspicious flows in distributed SDN, we devise an optimal threshold model by balancing the trade-off between collaboration efficiency and prediction effectiveness. We also explore and build on the LSTM model to design an algorithm for collaborative prediction and detection of DDoS Attacks. Experiment results on a number of datasets demonstrate the promising performance of CoWatch in effectiveness and efficiency.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

Automatic accurate segmentation of risky lesions in the nasopharynx is crucial in radiotherapy. U-Net has been proved its effective medical image segmentation ability. However, the great difference in the structure and size of nasopharynx among different patients requires a network that pays more attention to multi-scale information. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale sensitive U-Net (MSU-Net) based on pixel-edge-region level collaborative loss (LCo−PER) for NPC segmentation task. A series of novel feature fusion modules based on spatial continuity and multi-scale semantic are proposed for extracting multi-level features while efficiently searching for all size lesions. A spatial continuity information extraction module (SCIEM) is proposed for effectively using the spatial continuity information of context slices to search small lesions. And a multi-scale semantic feature extraction module (MSFEM) is proposed for extracting features of different receptive fields. LCo−PER is proposed for the network training which makes network model could take into account the size of different lesions.

To be successful in CPS requires not only CPS skills but also positive attitudes towards collaboration (i.e., collaboration dispositions). However, the relationship between CPS skills and collaboration dispositions has not been studied much, especially among early adolescent students. The purpose of this study is to investigate the dimensions of students' collaboration dispositions and their relationship to students' assessed CPS skills (i.e., social and cognitive skills of CPS, see Hesse et al., [2015]). Data were collected from 214 Finnish sixth-grade students (Meanage = 12.44, SDage = 0.32, female = 116, 54.21%) in 2019. Students' CPS skills were assessed based on the log file data collected from student pairs' participation in four tasks in a computer-based assessment environment. Collaboration dispositions were measured through a self-report questionnaire. Exploratory factor analysis was applied to investigate the dimensions of students' collaboration dispositions. In addition, analysis of variance was utilised to examine the dimensions of students' collaboration dispositions across their diverse social and cognitive CPS skills. Three dimensions of students' collaboration dispositions were identified, namely, negotiation, advocate/guide and cooperation. Further, we found that the early adolescent students’ CPS social skills, but not cognitive skills of CPS, were associated with their perceived collaboration dispositions. Based on our results, we argue that it is crucial to provide systematic and rigorous interventions and/or models to pay attention not only to integrating CPS skills with subject studies in schools, but also to make students aware of their collaboration dispositions.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

The end-to-end method based on graph neural network (GNN), representing a contemporary technical hotspot, can comprehensively mine KG information. However, most GNN-based models (1) primarily emphasize the relative signals between users and items, and the collaborative signals among the users, but overlook the collaborative signals among the items; (2) generally struggle to effectively distinguish between cold-start items and general items in embedding learning. These drawbacks will cause insufficient information and low accuracy of item representations, further impairing the interpretability and accuracy of recommendation. To tackle them, Knowledge graph fine-grained network with attribute transfer for recommendation (KGFA) is proposed in this paper to address the insufficient correlations mining among items and inadequate cold-start item representation information in the knowledge-aware recommendation. Specifically, our method adopts attentive combination of intents to model user representation at a fine-grained level, and differentiates the contribution of diverse intents to user behavior for better model interpretability. Moreover, the cold-start items’ neighbors are further propagated in our meticulously designed item attribute transfer space to thoroughly excavate the collaborative signals between items and enrich the information in the cold-start item representations.

The phase composition changes from a single FCC phase to FCC and complex multiple carbide phases of WC-rich carbides + Cr-rich carbides. The microstructures are typical dendritic structures, multi and hierarchical carbides appear in the interdendritic region, and many eutectic carbides begin to emerge. Multiple carbides make up large amounts of clusters, and eutectic carbides play a continuous bridging role between the W-rich, Cr-rich carbides and the FCC solid solution. The microhardness of the coatings increases from 191.8 to 503.4 HV, while the mechanical properties of the interdendritic region are better than those of the dendritic region.

However, when reconstructing the workspace in 3D using depth cameras mounted on a telepresence robot or worker, the back of workers or objects in front of the depth cameras becomes a blind spot and cannot be captured. Therefore, when a person in a remote location views the 3D-reconstructed workspace, the person cannot see workers or objects in the blind spot.

MethodsRetrospective data harmonization was performed on three Italian population-based studies: the Italian Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ILSA), the Progetto Veneto Anziani (Pro.V.A.), and the Bollate Eye Study-Follow-Up (BEST-FU). The associations between undernutrition, operationalized using the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria, and decline on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or dementia incidence follow-up were evaluated with Cox proportional hazard regression models. ResultsThe pooled cohort comprised 9071 individuals (52% females) aged between 42 and 101 years. The prevalence of undernutrition at the baseline was 14.3%, significantly higher among females (15.4% vs 13%) and in older age, ranging from 3.5% in those aged <60 years to 28.8% in those 85+ years. Undernutrition was associated with both cognitive decline over a median 8.3-year follow-up (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.20, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.02–1.41, p = 0.028) and incidence of dementia over a median 8.6-year follow-up (HR = 1.57, 95%CI 1.01–2.43, p = 0.046). For cognitive decline, the association with undernutrition was more marked in males than females (HR = 1.36, 95%CI 1.05–1.77, p = 0.019 vs HR = 1.10, 95% CI 0.89–1.36, p = 0.375). ConclusionUndernutrition is prevalent among older people and is associated with an increased risk of experiencing cognitive decline and dementia. The prevention and early identification of undernutrition could be an important nonpharmacologic strategy to counteract neurodegeneration.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

This results in a mismatch between the perceived virtual and physical movement, which is known to cause VR sickness. However, it is unclear if different types of walking techniques (e.g., resetting, reorientation, or self-overlapping spaces) affect VR sickness differently. To address this, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 96 papers published in 2016–2022 that measure VR sickness in walking-based locomotion. We find different VR sickness effects between types of redirection and between normal walking and redirection. However, we also identified several problems with the use and reporting of VR sickness measures.

However, the main problem restricting its development is the high energy and computational consumption in 3D video rendering on VR devices. To address this issue, we propose a novel coordinated multi-point (CoMP) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) assisted system, where the video is rendered by multiple collaborative mobile edge computing (MEC) servers simultaneously. Besides, BSs associated with these MEC servers are formed as a CoMP cluster to achieve a high data rate. This paper aims to minimize long-term power consumption by jointly optimizing the video caching and rendering at the MEC servers and the beamforming for both BSs and RIS. We propose an online, hybrid learning framework that combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for video caching and rendering, and an alternating optimization for the beamforming of all BSs and the RIS. In particular, the reward of each action in the DRL algorithm is calculated by the proposed alternating optimization problem, thus reducing the action space and accelerating convergence speed. Numerical results and comparison experiments show that our proposed method can effectively reduce the long-term average power consumption of the system, satisfy the requirement of 3D video transmission with low computational complexity, and outperform that without CoMP and RIS techniques.",4,2,4,"{'ar', 'vr', 'collaborative', 'virtual reality'}","{'vr': 1, 'virtual reality': 1, 'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

However, the growing demands from users and the limited computing and storage resources of UAVs present significant challenges in designing an efficient edge service caching scheme to minimize latency. Moreover, the integration of service caching and task offloading complicates the support of complex tasks by a single UAV. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel two-tier UAV-assisted VECNs framework. In this framework, multi-rotor UAVs function as hovering nodes for computational offloading, while a fixed-wing UAV serves as a mobile auxiliary cloud platform, forming a cohesive UAV group. User tasks are structured into a task chain based on the available UAVs. We integrate a joint service chain caching and task offloading scheme that considers UAV computing and storage capacities, duplicate caching, and dynamic transmission latency. To optimize task chain completion latency, we propose an Attention-based Multi-Agent Deep Q-Network (A-MADQN) algorithm. This algorithm incorporates an attention mechanism to narrow the UAV selection space, enabling the selected UAVs to collaboratively make caching and task offloading decisions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances system processing efficiency and reduces task completion latency compared to the benchmark approaches.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

10.1109/GEM.2018.8516499,Evaluating Embodied Navigation in Virtual Reality Environments,"Virtual reality has become more accessible and affordable to the general public in recent years, introducing the exciting potential of this technology to new audiences. However, the mechanisms of navigating within a virtual environment have primarily been constrained to handheld input devices akin to gaming controllers. For people unfamiliar with traditional gaming input devices, VR navigation devices are not intuitively mapped to real-world modes of locomotion and can be frustrating and disorienting. Designers have largely focused on utility (the ability to efficiently accomplish a task) to the detriment of usability (ease of use). The industry lacks an intuitive, universal method of navigation that can be easily learned by novice participants. Dr. Jakob Nielsen identified five factors that impact usability in human-computer interactions (HCI): learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors, and satisfaction. Previous research in virtual environment locomotion incorporated teaching time periods where the researchers explained the control devices to participants. We believe that this neglected one of the key usability factors in human-computer interactions: learnability, or the ability and ease to accomplish a task the first time a user encounters it. Our research focuses on comparing existing modes of navigation (game controller based) with a mode of controller-less fully embodied navigation between two demographics based on Nielsen's usability factors. Existing research has demonstrated little noticeable learnability difference between modes of rotation and lean-based navigation, and joystick navigation in VR [1]; however, similar study demonstrates that partially embodied leaning mechanics can positively affect sensory perception in VR [2]. While previous Studies in controller-less VR navigation methods have demonstrated an inclination toward subject motion sickness when controllers are removed [3], other research has yielded positive qualitative results (sans motion sickness) when partially embodied alternative controller systems are used [4]. Additional research into partially embodied alternative controller systems has, in fact, indicated a preference toward existing modes of controller-based joystick navigation in VR subjects [5]; however, when partially embodied leaning mechanics are combined with another mode of sensory perception, like foot haptics, self-motion perception (vection) is enhanced [6]. In this study, we test a fully embodied mode of navigation to evaluate whether a fully engaged body experiences more positive usability results according to HCI measures. We test our results within communities of self-identified gamers and non-gamers, evaluating navigation modes designed for joystick control pads, trigger-based teleportation, and controller-less embodied navigation. Our research inquires whether embodied navigation enhances usability in accordance with Nielsen's usability factors, specifically enabling easier access and engagement for inexperienced subj e ct s, compared with controller-based modes of navigation.",3,1,3,"{'ar', 'vr', 'virtual reality'}","{'vr': 1, 'virtual reality': 1, 'ar': 1}",

We evaluated the co-designed widgets in a virtual reality simulation supported by a realistic setup with a tracked phantom patient, a virtual magnifying loupe, and a dentist's foot pedal. The user study involved 35 dentists with various backgrounds and years of experience. The findings demonstrated significant results; DWs outperform SWs in positional and rotational precision, especially with younger generations and subjects with gaming experiences. The user preference remains for DWs (19) instead of SWs (16). However, findings indicated that the precision positively correlates with the time trade-off. The post-experience questionnaire (NASA-TLX) showed that DWs increase mental and physical demand, effort, and frustration more than SWs.

10.1016/j.patcog.2023.110064,NCL++: Nested Collaborative Learning for long-tailed visual recognition,"Long-tailed visual recognition has received increasing attention in recent years. Due to the extremely imbalanced data distribution in long-tailed learning, the learning process shows great uncertainties. For example, the predictions of different experts on the same image vary remarkably despite the same training settings. To alleviate the uncertainty, we propose a Nested Collaborative Learning (NCL++) which tackles the long-tailed learning problem by a collaborative learning. To be specific, the collaborative learning consists of two folds, namely inter-expert collaborative learning (InterCL) and intra-expert collaborative learning (IntraCL). InterCL learns multiple experts collaboratively and concurrently, aiming to transfer the knowledge among different experts. IntraCL is similar to InterCL, but it aims to conduct the collaborative learning on multiple augmented copies of the same image within the single expert. To achieve the collaborative learning in long-tailed learning, the balanced online distillation is proposed to force the consistent predictions among different experts and augmented copies, which reduces the learning uncertainties. Moreover, in order to improve the meticulous distinguishing ability on the confusing categories, we further propose a Hard Category Mining (HCM), which selects the negative categories with high predicted scores as the hard categories. Then, the collaborative learning is formulated in a nested way, in which the learning is conducted on not just all categories from a full perspective but some hard categories from a partial perspective. Extensive experiments manifest the superiority of our method with outperforming the state-of-the-art whether with using a single model or an ensemble.

A consensus panel of Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative-affiliated urologists who routinely manage renal masses was formed. Areas of consensus (defined >80% agreement) about T1RM AS were established iteratively via 3 rounds of online questionnaires. ResultsTwenty-six Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative urologists formed the panel. Consensus was achieved for 321/587 scenarios (54.7%) administered through 124 questions. Life expectancy, age, comorbidity, and renal function were most important for patient selection, with life expectancy ranking first. All tumors <3 cm and all patients with life expectancy <1 year were considered appropriate for AS. Appropriateness also increased with elevated perioperative risk, increasing tumor complexity, and/or declining renal function. Consensus was for multiphasic axial imaging initially (contrast CT for GFR >60 or MRI for GFR >30) with first repeat imaging at 3-6 months and subsequent imaging timing determined by tumor size. Consensus was for chest imaging for tumors >3 cm initially and >5 cm at follow up. Renal biopsy was not felt to be a requirement for entering AS, but useful in several scenarios.

These studies mostly used qualitative methods and focused on the collaborative aspect of such construct (Galaczi, 2008). The present study adopts a quantitative approach to explore and describe L2 interaction, utilizing the data of the Corpus of Collaborative Oral Tasks (CCOT). Specifically, it measures pairs’ interaction by creating a composite score of interactivity to understand the relationship between the dyads' degree of interactivity and their use of lexico-grammatical features as well as their L2 fluency. Pearson's correlation tests showed weak to moderate positive relationships between interactivity and discourse particles, response forms, wh-questions, and second person pronouns. Additionally, the tests revealed weak negative relationships between interactivity and both nominal forms and hesitations. Furthermore, revealing moderate relationships, Pearson's correlation tests showed that interactivity was associated with more fluent L2 speech, where learners of higher interactivity levels tended to produce fewer silent pauses and faster speech rates. The study provides insights for scholars interested in L2 interaction. It suggests that some linguistic features were not only associated with collaborative behaviors (as reported in the literature) but also with interactivity as broad aspect. Furthermore, it provides a description of how the act of turn taking might potentially serve the fluency of higher interactivity students, warranting further investigation of turn frequency among L2 test takers as test raters might potentially be influenced by the test candidates’ fluency.

Results of the first stage of the study, obtained through personal interviews, suggest that this dichotomy between bureaucratic and dan controls, in many cases, may not reflect actual coordination processes.

These systems offer personalised recommendations to users. The superiority of multi-criteria recommender systems over their single-criterion counterparts has been demonstrated, as the former are able to provide more precise recommendations by taking into account multiple dimensions of user preferences when rating items. The prevalent recommendation technique, matrix factorization of collaborative filtering, is hindered by the data sparsity problem of the user-item matrix. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that deep learning techniques have demonstrated significant potential in various research domains, including but not limited to image processing, pattern recognition, computer vision, and natural language processing. In recent times, there has been a surge in the utilisation of deep learning techniques in recommender systems, yielding promising outcomes. This study presents a novel approach to multi-criteria recommender systems through the utilisation of deep learning algorithms to mitigate the data sparsity issue.

Creation and maintenance of these experiences can be difficult for faculty members, especially faculty at community hospitals or those with multiple roles and responsibilities at their practice site. The purpose of this article is to reflect on the development process and student acceptance of a collaborative, three-day a week internal medicine rounding student experience. DescriptionInstead of a traditional five-day a week rounding schedule with a single, primary faculty preceptor, students participated in a three-day a week internal medicine rounding experience where their primary faculty preceptor had a faculty partner who functioned as a substitute. The student activities on the other days were adapted by each faculty preceptor based on their internal medicine subspecialty duties and needs of the practice site. Analysis/InterpretationResults from a seven-question, anonymous survey to students who participated in the three-day a week internal medicine rounds found high impact on their reported confidence and knowledge.

/doi/10.1145/3678957.3685753,First-Person Perspective Induces Stronger Feelings of Awe and Presence Compared to Third-Person Perspective inVirtualReality,"Awe is a complex emotion described as a perception of vastness and a need for accommodation to integrate new, overwhelming experiences. Virtual Reality (VR) has recently gained attention as a convenient means to facilitate experiences of awe. In VR, a first-person perspective might increase awe due to its immersive nature, while a third-person perspective might enhance the perception of vastness. However, the impact of VR perspectives on experiencing awe has not been thoroughly examined. We created two types of VR scenes: one with elements designed to induce high awe, such as a snowy mountain, and a low awe scene without such elements. We compared first-person and third-person perspectives in each scene. Forty-two participants explored the VR scenes, with their physiological responses captured by electrocardiogram (ECG) and face tracking (FT). Subsequently, participants self-reported their experience of awe (AWE-S) and presence (IPQ) within VR. The results revealed that the first-person perspective induced stronger feelings of awe and presence than the third-person perspective.

The agents imperfect measurements yield localization errors that degrade the quality of service at the base station due to unknown phase offsets in the channels. Assuming that the localization errors follow Gaussian distributions, we study the design of a one-shot (non-iterative) beamforming strategy that ensures reliable communication between the agents and the base station despite the localization errors. We formulate a risk-sensitive discrete optimization problem to choose an agent subset for transmission so that the desired signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the base station is attained with minimum variance. We show that, when the localization errors have small variances characterized in terms of the carrier frequency, greedy algorithms globally minimize the variance of the received SINR. Moreover, when the localization errors have large variances, we show that the variance of the received SINR can be locally minimized by exploiting the supermodularity of the mean and variance of the received SINR. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithms synthesize beamformers orders of magnitude faster than convex optimization-based approaches while achieving comparable performance with fewer agents.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

To address these challenges, this paper explores a simple approach, called Visual Integration (VI), which purposefully limits the exchange of information to only visual artifacts for generating interactive views. VI integrates 3D images from disparate sources in real-time, by comparing the depth information at every combined pixel. VI also preserves independent interactive views of the integrated data for all parties.

Examples of application domains that could benefit from social networks are e-democracy, e-participation, online surveys, crowdsourcing, and proximity-based services. In all the above cases, users’ anonymity could represent a considerable added value or could be even necessary to develop the service. We observe that all the above domains are characterized by the fact that only a few asynchronous messages should be exchanged. Therefore, we do not need the full communication power of anonymous communication networks, in which low-latency and connection-oriented communication should be supported. On the other hand, unlike communication networks, the threat model we have to consider assumes the presence of an adversary (represented by an honest-but-curious social network provider) able to monitor the entire flow of the exchanged messages. In this paper, we propose an anonymous communication protocol for short communications in social networks, based on a collaborative approach. The proposed solution hides from the social network provider not only the content of the messages but also the communication itself, which, per se, can result in considerable privacy leakage (think of the case of proximity testing performed between two users). This enables the implementation, within the social network, of the above-mentioned applications. To give a concrete proof of this statement, we develop a privacy-preserving proximity-based solution which provides both symmetric and asymmetric proximity testing entirely within social networks.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

As far as my knowledge extends, only one relevant work delves into the correlation between innovation and collaboration with TSs, and no research has explored this relationship from a causal perspective. More precisely, previous studies suffer from several limitations in their examination of this topic: 1) Existing studies on Papers' Novelty (PN) primarily focus on calculating methods, with limited exploration of its relationship with scientific cooperation. 2) Research that has explored the link between collaboration with TSs and output innovation often adopts a correlational perspective, lacking a causal analysis that could correct for potential confounding factors. 3) Previous methodologies overlook the attributes of citation networks as potential confounding factors, a crucial consideration in identifying identical papers in causal analyses. 4) The impact of disciplinary diversity of papers on the innovation output when collaborating with TSs is often overlooked in prior research. To address these limitations, we conduct a causal analysis of publications in three subfields of computer science from the Web of Science (WoS) database to demonstrate the impact of collaborating with TSs on PN. Specifically, to tackle Limitations 1) and 2), we employ PN as a metric to assess the quality of academic output and explore its causal relationship with collaborating with TSs using the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) method. To address Limitation 3), we comprehensively consider potential confounding factors influencing PSM matching by further incorporating the attributes of citation networks, thereby minimizing selection bias. To deal with Limitation 4), we not only focus on the overall treatment effect but also delve into the treatment effect of intra-disciplinary and interdisciplinary collaboration modes. The research findings indicate that the papers collaborating with TSs exhibit lower PN compared to those without the participation of TSs. This suggests that collaboration with TSs may come at the cost of reduced novelty.

10.1016/j.neucom.2023.02.051,CAML: Contextual augmented meta-learning for cold-start recommendation,"The performance of recommendation engines is challenged by the cold-start issues. Classical recommendation techniques have limited capability to address this problem because the underlying machine learning models are data-thirsty. Conversely, the recent success of meta-learning attracted a lot of attention due to few-shot learning capabilities which can be employed to accommodate new tasks even when there are few data samples for training. Most of the meta-learning recommendation models adopt model-agnostic meta-learning to initialize parameters that may lead to stuck into local optima instead of global optima for some users. To leverage the learning process, we propose a Contextually Augmented Meta-Learning recommender system (CAML). The proposed method augments the contextual features into a meta-learning model which considerably improves the tasks adaptation capability. We constructed a Data Augmentation Unit (DAU) that used a hybrid similarity to augment data samples of similar neighbors. The augmented samples are then forwarded to a Meta-Learner (MetaL) to learn user preferences and generate relevant recommendations. Additionally, we highlighted that the proposed method is generalized and can be adapted for various meta-learning-based recommendation models. We validate our proposal on three benchmark datasets for both ranking and rating prediction perspectives.

Influence maximization is a crucial research topic, in these networks, as it can help in comprehending the mechanisms of information propagation and diffusion. Effectively utilizing complex structural information poses a challenge in current research on influence maximization in heterogeneous information networks. As a solution to this problem, a heterogeneous network influence maximization algorithm based on the multi-scale propagation strength and repulsive force of propagation field is proposed. Firstly, based on the propagation field, we design a multi-scale propagation strength index for the propagation ability of nodes to achieve maximum coverage of influence propagation. Specifically, in the homogeneous structure, the homogeneous propagation strength describes the propagation ability of nodes. In the heterogeneous structure, the heterogeneous shallow propagation strength and the heterogeneous deep propagation strength are designed to exploit the local and global spreading ability of nodes using meta-paths and link prediction based on graph neural networks, respectively. Secondly, to ensure the minimum overlap in the propagation range of seed nodes, we designed the overlapping repulsive force between node pairs in the propagation field. Finally, considering the complexity of the propagation process of heterogeneous information networks, an independent cascade model based on meta-paths is proposed.

However, the emergence of cyber-physical attacks, such as dynamic load-altering attacks (DLAAs) has introduced great challenges to the security of smart energy grids. Thus, this study developed a novel cyber-physical collaborative security framework for DLAAs in smart energy grids. The proposed framework integrates attack prediction in the cyber layer with the detection and localization of attacks in the physical layer. First, a data-driven method was proposed to predict the DLAA sequence in the cyber layer. By designing a double radial basis function network, the influence of disturbances on attack prediction can be eliminated. Based on the prediction results, an unknown input observer-based detection and localization method was further developed for the physical layer. In addition, an adaptive threshold was designed to replace the traditional precomputed threshold and improve the detection performance of the DLAAs. Consequently, through the collaborative work of the cyber-physics layer, injected DLAAs were effectively detected and located. Compared with existing methodologies, the simulation results on IEEE 14-bus and 118- bus power systems verified the superiority of the proposed cyber-physical collaborative detection and localization against DLAAs.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

Despite the success of current bundle recommendation approaches, there are still significant challenges: (1) Multiple associations (e.g., user-bundle interactions, bundle-item affiliations, etc.) in bundle recommendation. (2) People’s interactions with a single item and a bundle follow different patterns, e.g., users can quickly decide whether to purchase an item, but hard to determine with a bundle regardless of what items are included. (3) The data sparsity of user-bundle historical interactions. This paper proposes a Unified Hypergraph framework for Bundle Recommendation (UHBR) to tackle the aforementioned challenges. Specifically, UHBR first unifies multiple associations among users, bundles, and items into hypergraph, a more flexible and scalable data graph structure. Second, this hypergraph architecture allows both direct and indirect user-bundle relationships through items to be efficiently and comprehensively represented as hyperedges. Third, we leverage the potential of indirect association to diminish the impact of user-bundle interaction scarcity. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show that UHBR outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by 15.9% on Recall and 19.8% on NDCG.

Recent work showed that some factors, such as the LT used and the type of trajectory, can influence UPD. However, little is known about the influence of rotation gains (commonly used in redirection-based LTs) on UPD during navigation in VR. In this paper, we conducted two user studies to assess the influence of rotation gains on UPD. In the first study, participants had to perform consecutive turns in a corridor virtual environment. In the second study, participants had to explore a large office floor and collect spheres freely. We compared the conditions between rotation gains and without gains, and we also varied the turning angle to perform the turns while considering factors such as sensitivity to cybersickness and the learning effect.

Although existing indices based on spectral power of empirical frequency bands are able to describe the attentional state in some way, the reliability still needs to be improved. This paper proposed a subject-specific attention index based on the weighted spectral power. Unlike traditional indices, the ranges of frequency bands are not empirical but obtained from subject-specific change patterns of spectral power of electroencephalograph (EEG) to overcome the great inter-subject variance. In addition, the contribution of each frequency component in the frequency band is considered different. Specifically, the ratio of power spectral density (PSD) function in attentional and inattentional state is utilized to calculate the weight to enhance the effectiveness of the proposed index. The proposed subject-specific attention index based on the weighted spectral power is evaluated on two open datasets including EEG data of a total of 44 subjects. The results of the proposed index are compared with 3 traditional attention indices using various statistical analysis methods including significance tests and distribution variance measurements. According to the experimental results, the proposed index can describe the attentional state more accurately. The proposed index respectively achieves accuracies of 86.21% and 70.00% at the 1% significance level in both the t-test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for two datasets, which obtains improvements of 41.38% and 20.00% compared to the best result of the traditional indices. These results indicate that the proposed index provides an efficient way to measure attentional state.",1,1,1,{'ar'},{'ar': 1},

These works are inspired by nature and collaborate effectively with the natural process occurring on the site. Other outcomes of the projects are to increase ecological services on the site, and to involve and educate the human members of communities who live or work near the sites. The human users of the site can see and interact with the site issues while these very issues are being actively solved. Other species can reap the ecological benefits of expanded habitat and rainwater conservation. These projects have the added benefit of giving a visual explanation for the processes at work on the site. Artful Nature Based Solutions bring a new depth of understanding to the site issues because they regard the site through a combined focus of art and science.

A key method in this field is Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), which has become a dominant approach for implicit collaborative filtering. However, the challenge of false-positive and false-negative examples in implicit feedback continues to hinder accurate preference learning. In this study, we introduce an efficient self-supervised contrastive learning framework that enhances the supervisory signal by incorporating positive feature augmentation and negative label augmentation. Our theoretical analysis reveals that this approach is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood estimation with latent variables representing user interest centers. Additionally, we present a novel negative label augmentation technique that selects unlabeled examples based on their relative ranking positions, enabling efficient augmentation with constant time complexity.

To facilitate secure integration of data efficiently for building an accurate SVM classifier, we present a non-interactive protocol for privacy-preserving SVM, named NPSVMT. Specifically, we define a new well-separated structure for computing gradients that can decouple the fusion matter between user data and model parameters, allowing data providers to outsource the collaborative learning task to the cloud. As a result, NPSVMT is capable of removing the multiple communications and eliminating the straggler’s effect (waiting for the last), thereby going beyond those developed with interactive methods, e.g., federated learning. To further decrease the data traffic, we introduce a high-efficient coding method to compress and parse training data. In addition, unlike outsourced schemes based on homomorphic encryption or secret sharing, NPSVMT exploits functional encryption to maintain the data confidentiality, achieving dropout-tolerant secure aggregation. The implementations verify that NPSVMT is faster by orders of magnitude than the existing privacy-preserving SVM schemes on benchmark datasets.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

Utilizing graph neural networks for knowledge-aware recommendation is a recent trend. However, there are two deficiencies in existing GNN-based knowledge-aware models: (1) They are coarse-grained in user representation, failing to capture the multi-interest distribution of users. (2) The supervised signals come only from historical interactions, failing to provide high-quality representations due to sparse data. In this paper, we propose a novel model, CMGAN with Contrastive Multi-interest Graph Attention Network, tailored for personalized knowledge-aware recommendations. Specifically, CMGAN employs a collaborative knowledge graph encoder, enhancing node representations through relational-aware embedding aggregation. Then a dynamic multi-interest generator crafts fine-grained multi-interest representations, adeptly extracting varied interests for each user based on their historical interactions. Furthermore, CMGAN innovates by integrating multi-level contrastive learning to refine representations at both node and multi-interest granularity. It consists of collaborative knowledge graph contrastive learning and multi-interest contrastive learning. The former pursues the acquisition of node representations that are more uniformly distributed, while the latter aims to obtain interest representations that are more distinct.

While numerous RSs have been applied in KIS platforms for task recommendation and worker recommendation, an RS specialized for KIS recommendation to meet employers’ potential needs is still missing. To this end, the heterogeneous multi-relations, including knowledge-service relations, activity-service relations, and worker-service relations, are investigated firstly to bridge the knowledge gap, and a novel methodology for KIS recommendation is proposed based on the heterogeneous multi-relations construction and fusion. This method develops a heterogeneous information network (HIN) to structure high-level interactions among employers, services, activities, and workers, and designs KIS-oriented meta-paths to obtain valuable heterogeneous multi-relations. Furthermore, these valuable relations are aggregated and fused hierarchically through metapath2vec and attention mechanism to learn representations of employers and services and further to predict the targeted employer's potential KIS needs. Finally, the transaction data from ZBJ.com - the largest KIS trading platform in China, is used to validate the effectiveness and high accuracy of the proposed method in KIS recommendation.

The multi-frequency radiometers AMSR-E and AMSR2 provide >20 years of data records, enabling the development of long-term SM and VOD products. Most of the current retrieval algorithms either only focus on SM or VOD, and generally ignore the polarization or simplify the frequency dependence of vegetation effects for reducing the unknowns and facilitating the retrieval process, limiting the synergic applicability of VOD and SM products in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. In this study, a new global SM and frequency- and polarization-dependent VOD product from 2002 to 2021 was developed using the multi-channel collaborative algorithm (MCCA), based on the inter-calibrated AMSR-E/2 multi-frequency passive microwave measurements. The MCCA algorithm comprehensively considers the physical relationship between multiple microwave channels and could retrieve frequency- and polarization-dependent VOD while considering the accuracy of the SM retrievals. In the overall comparison with other SM products (AMSR-ANN, CCI-passive v07.1, LPRM-C/X, JAXA) over 25 dense SM networks, MCCA achieved the best scores in terms of root mean square error (RMSE = 0.074 m3/m3), unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE = 0.073 m3/m3) and bias (0.007 m3/m3), and presented slightly lower value of Pearson's correlation coefficient (R = 0.709) than LPRM-X (R = 0.735).

10.1109/81.933326,Narrow-band interference cancellation in spread-spectrum communication systems using chaos,"A novel approach based on chaos theory is proposed to enhance narrow-band interference cancellation for spread spectrum communications. The method uses a chaotic system to generate binary sequences for spreading codes in a direct sequence spread spectrum system. Interference cancellation is therefore a problem of parameter estimation in chaotic noise. Because of the inherently deterministic nature of a chaotic signal, the interference cancellation capability can be improved by using a dynamic-based estimation technique called the minimum phase space volume (MPSV) method. Since the PSV complexity measure is usually a nonlinear function of the parameters, a genetic algorithm (GA) is incorporated into the MPSV method to form the GA-MPSV technique for narrow-band interference cancellation. Simulation results show that the chaotic approach consistently outperforms the conventional statistical method over a wide range of signal-to-interference ratios (SIR) in point-to-point communications, multiple user systems and multipath environments.",1,1,1,{'ar'},{'ar': 1},

Pharmacist-led CDTM can positively affect health outcomes leading to reduced healthcare expenditures. CDTM is underutilized, with < 1% of Georgia pharmacists holding an active license to practice CDTM. Objective(s)The objective of this study was to examine CDTM licensed pharmacists’ perceptions of facilitators and barriers in providing CDTM. MethodsGeorgia-licensed CDTM pharmacists were invited to participate in a 60-minute qualitative interview. Interview questions were developed from electronic survey responses. The interview was designed to elicit information regarding perceived benefits and barriers to CDTM implementation. Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, thematic analysis was applied to identify themes using ATLAS.ti software to code. Themes were described qualitatively and prevalence of each was reported. ResultsNine interviews were conducted, and data saturation was achieved at interview 6. After resolution of discrepancies, 100% coding agreement was reached among 2 independent researchers. Nine themes were identified, and each was categorized as a facilitator or barrier to establishing pharmacist-led CDTM in Georgia. Themes associated with facilitating were (prevalence %) (1) practice autonomy (100), (2) personal attributes (100), (3) having support (100), and (4) institutional logistics (88). Barrier themes included issues concerning (5) the Georgia BOP (100), (6) pharmacist autonomy (88), (7) lack of provider status (88), (8) institutional restrictions (75), and (9) personal development (e.g., confidence) (22).

In multi-party WebRTC videoconferencing using scalable video coding, a selective forwarding unit (SFU) provides connectivity between peers with heterogeneous bandwidth and terminals. An important question is where in the network to place the SFU service in order to minimize end-to-end delay between all pairs of peers. Clearly, there is no single optimal place for a cloud SFU for all possible peer locations. We propose placing virtual SFUs at network edges leveraging NSP edge datacenters to optimize end-to-end delay and usage of overall network resources. The main advantage of the distributed edge-SFU framework is that each peer video stream travels the shortest path to reach other peers similar to mesh connection model, whereas each peer uploads a single stream to its edge-SFU avoiding the upload bottleneck. While the proposed distributed edge-SFU framework applies to both best-effort and managed service models, this paper proposes a premium managed, edge-integrated multi-party WebRTC service architecture with bandwidth and delay guarantees within access networks by SDN-assisted slicing of edge networks.

Subsequently, a collaborative, robust dispatch model was constructed considering the annual uncertainty of the carbon price and the daily uncertainty of renewable-energy generation. The model is solved using the column-and-constraint generation algorithm. An operation and cost model of a carbon-capture power plant (CCPP) that couples the carbon market and the economic operation of the power system is also established. The critical, profitable conditions for the economic operation of the CCPP were derived. Case studies demonstrated that the proposed low-carbon, robust dispatch model reduced carbon emissions by 2.67% compared with the traditional, economic, dispatch method. The total fuel cost of generation decreases with decreasing, conservative, carbon-price-uncertainty levels, while total carbon emissions continue to increase.

10.1016/j.comcom.2024.107962,Optimizing point-of-sale services in MEC enabled near field wireless communications using multi-agent reinforcement learning,"In the next-generation communication system, near-field communication (NFC) is a key enabler of contactless transactions, including mobile payments, ticketing, and access control. With the growing demand for contactless solutions, NFC technology will play a pivotal role in enabling secure and convenient payment experiences across various sectors. In contrast, Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as phones’ Point of Sale (PoS) constitute limited battery life and finite computational resources that act as a bottleneck to doing the authentication in a minimal amount of time. Because of this, it garnered considerable attention in both academic and industrial realms. To overcome this, in this work we consider the Multiple Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) as an effective solution that provides extensive computation to PoS connected to it. To address the above, this work considers the PoS-enabled multi-MEC network to guarantee NFC communication reliably and effectively. For this, we formulate the joint optimization problem to maximize the probability of successful authentication while minimizing the queueing delay by jointly optimizing the computation and communication resources by utilizing a multi-agent reinforcement learning optimization approach. Through extensive simulations based on real-world scenarios, the effectiveness of the proposed approach was demonstrated. The results demonstrate that adjusting the complexity and learning rates of the model, coupled with strategic allocation of edge resources, significantly increased authentication success rates. Furthermore, the optimal allocation strategy was found to be crucial in reducing latency and improving authentication success by approximately 9.75%, surpassing other approaches. This study highlights the importance of resource management in optimizing MEC systems, paving the way for advancements in establishing secure, efficient, and dependable systems within the Internet of Things framework.",1,1,1,{'ar'},{'ar': 1},
/doi/10.1145/3617232.3624860,ExploitingHuman Color Discrimination for Memory- and Energy-Efficient Image Encoding inVirtualReality,"Virtual Reality (VR) has the potential of becoming the next ubiquitous computing platform. Continued progress in the burgeoning field of VR depends critically on an efficient computing substrate. In particular, DRAM access energy is known to contribute to a significant portion of system energy. Today's framebuffer compression system alleviates the DRAM traffic by using a numerically lossless compression algorithm. Being numerically lossless, however, is unnecessary to preserve perceptual quality for humans. This paper proposes a perceptually lossless, but numerically lossy, system to compress DRAM traffic. Our idea builds on top of long-established psychophysical studies that show that humans cannot discriminate colors that are close to each other. The discrimination ability becomes even weaker (i.e., more colors are perceptually indistinguishable) in our peripheral vision. Leveraging the color discrimination (in)ability, we propose an algorithm that adjusts pixel colors to minimize the bit encoding cost without introducing visible artifacts. The algorithm is coupled with lightweight architectural support that, in real-time, reduces the DRAM traffic by 66.9% and outperforms existing framebuffer compression mechanisms by up to 20.4%. Psychophysical studies on human participants show that our system introduce little to no perceptual fidelity degradation.",3,1,3,"{'ar', 'vr', 'virtual reality'}","{'vr': 1, 'virtual reality': 1, 'ar': 1}",

The escalating impacts of climate change in the Canadian Arctic have created ample opportunities for Arctic shipping activities related to fishing, cruise tourism, resource (mineral) transportation, research, and government services. Nowadays, the necessity of developing a sustainable economy, the need for environmental protection, and the imperative of reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples present considerable challenges for the Canadian government in regulating Arctic shipping. To comprehend the contemporary issues of Arctic shipping governance, this paper conducts an overview of the history of Arctic shipping activities in Canada and reviews Canada’s diverse policies and laws that have been instituted to govern Arctic shipping. Drawing upon the analysis of these policies, the article advocates for a collaborative governance framework to cope with the multifaceted challenges confronting the governance of Arctic shipping in Canada.

In this system, how to optimize the deployment of UAVs is important for providing good service for all mobile users. Specifically, for each mobile user, we need to determine whether the task can be performed locally or on the drone (i.e., the unload decision) and how much resources should be allocated. In this paper, a new two-level optimization method is proposed for UAV deployment and task scheduling problem to minimize the system energy consumption. The proposed algorithm is named TSHGHSDE algorithm, in which a few features are designed to enhance the algorithm performance. Firstly, a two-stage optimization strategy is proposed based on HS-DE algorithm. In the early stage, HS algorithm is used for the local search in a limited space, and the DE algorithm is employed for the global search in the late stage. Secondly, we design an effective control parameter to adjust the search process, which aims to effectively combine the local search ability of HS algorithm and the global search ability of DE algorithm. Thirdly, a novel encoding mechanism is proposed in the process of the UAV deployment optimization. A global search strategy is designed to enhance the performance of the proposed algorithm. To assess the performance of the proposed algorithm, some well-known algorithms are used for comparison in experiments.

Several professional organizations have established recommendations on comprehensive, collaborative approaches to treatment to meet the needs of this population, but information on real-world application is lacking. Sites participating in the NIDA CTN0080 “Medication treatment for Opioid use disorder in expectant Mothers (MOMs)”—a randomized clinical trial of extended release compared to sublingual buprenorphine among pregnant and postpartum individuals (PPI)—were selected, in part, because they have a collaborative approach to treating PPI with opioid use disorder (OUD). However, organizational differences among sites and how they implement expert recommendations for collaborative care could impact study outcomes. MethodsPrior to study launch at each of the 13 MOMs sites, investigators used the Pregnancy and Addiction Services Assessment (PAASA) to collect information about organizational factors. Input from a team of addiction, perinatal, and economic evaluation experts guided the development of the PAASA. Investigators programmed the PAASA into a web-based data system and summarized the resultant site data using descriptive statistics. ResultsStudy sites represented four US census regions. Most sites were specialty obstetrics & gynecology (OB/GYN) programs providing OUD services (n = 9, 69.2 %), were affiliated with an academic institution (n = 11, 84.6 %), and prescribed buprenorphine in an ambulatory/outpatient setting (n = 11, 84.6 %); all sites offered access to naloxone. Sites reported that their population was primarily White, utilized public insurance, and faced numerous psychosocial barriers to treatment. Although all sites offered many services recommended by expert consensus groups, they varied in how they coordinated these services. ConclusionsBy providing the organizational characteristics of sites participating in the MOMs study, this report assists in filling the current gap in knowledge regarding similar programs providing services to PPI with OUD. Collaborative care programs such as those participating in MOMs are uniquely positioned to participate in research to determine the most effective models of care and to determine how research can be integrated into those clinical care settings.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

The current state-of-the-art methods have effectively explored spatio-temporal contextual features and users’ long-term and short-term preference patterns. Nevertheless, most existing work lacks the ability to effectively capture group movement patterns from trajectory collaboration. Additionally, they pay close attention to the accuracy of personalized recommendations, neglecting recommendation diversity, which refers to offering broader location options that extend beyond a user’s typical preferences, thereby avoiding excessive homogeneity or repetition. To address these gaps, this study proposes a Collaborative Trajectory Representation model (CTRNext), which enhances the diversity of recommendations while maintaining the precision of personalized preferences. To be specific, we first design two trajectory embedding layers to extract joint semantic interactions and the explicit spatiotemporal context-aware representation. Then, a trajectory semantic similarity calculation module that captures collaborative signals from potentially similar-minded users and eliminates barriers caused by trajectory length is proposed. Next, the implicit correlation and further updated representation between different check-in records are achieved through a multi-head self-attention aggregation module. Finally, we put forward a dual-driven user preference matching module to generate the preference-based next POI recommendation while enhancing diversity.

Notably, rocG overexpression resulted in an excessive ATP accumulation in sporulating cells, leading to adverse effects on future spore properties, e.g. increased germination efficiency, reduced DPA content, and lowered heat resistance. Additionally, we revealed that Ald-mediated alanine metabolism was highly related to the inhibition of premature germination and the maintenance of spore dormancy during sporulation, which might be achieved by decreasing the typical germinant L-alanine concentration in sporulating environment.

This challenge revolves around strategically harnessing the energy-carbon synergy advantages within these systems, while factoring in the heterogeneity among different communities and the constraints imposed by electrical connectivity devices. Facing the challenge, this paper proposes an individualized adaptive distributed approach for energy-carbon coordination in MCIES with power transformers (PT-MCIES). Firstly, a feasible region is constructed based on current and temperature limits to assess the loading capacity of power transformers. Based on this, a transactive energy (TE) based co-optimization model for PT-MCIES considering energy sharing and carbon trading is developed, where rolling horizon optimization is adopted to cope with the randomness from renewable energy and loads. For the TE problem, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is employed to achieve distributed optimization. Uncertain renewable energy and loads, along with variable rolling horizons, make it difficult for the traditional ADMM to ensure convergence speed in the co-optimization of PT-MCIES. Accordingly, an individualized adaptive ADMM (IAADMM) embedded a spectral penalty parameter selection rule is adopted. Simulation results show that the proposed scheduling model can effectively guarantee the safe operation of power transformers with the suggestion of a feasible region, and achieve higher economic and environmental benefits than the reference one that ignores energy-carbon coordination. Furthermore, the proposed IAADMM exhibits superior performance in terms of convergence speed and robustness to the initial penalty parameter when compared to ADMM and its various variants.",1,1,1,{'ar'},{'ar': 1},

With the continuous development of deep learning technology, network traffic classification technology starts to use supervised learning paradigm to automate traffic identification by extracting some features. However, due to the continuous emergence of new private protocols, network services and access devices, the overall distribution of network traffic data is constantly changing. The training of network traffic classification models usually relies on the labeled data collected by academic organizations, institutions and companies. These data are usually generated in a fixed network environment, and the types of labels collected are limited. Models trained in this way are difficult to adapt to the open and complex network environment. Furthermore, the unevenly distributed computing resources affect the model training efficiency because the collected traffic data is usually concentrated in the end system but the computing power is generally concentrated in the edge computing nodes and cloud centers. Federated learning technology can coordinate data holders to train globally adapted models from discrete data. At the same time, split learning technology can realize more efficient model separation training. In this paper, we designed a new three-tier algorithm Hier-SFL combining and improving these two learning frameworks according to the common client-edge-cloud structure. Hier-SFL algorithm allocated the training task of neural network to each level network device with different computing resources.

It demonstrates the convergence between VR and AR technology for engineering design and onboard vehicle visualization systems. Initially, VR technology was mostly driven by virtual engineering design needs in the automotive and aircraft industries as well as by the gaming industry. Recently, the strong development of VR helmets and more recently AR glasses, initiated by Facebook’s Oculus industrial development, and also the advent of wide field of view (FOV) head up  display (HUD)s and AR display systems, which provide information to the driver and passengers, have brought significant enhancements in visual quality. The recent development of wearable glasses, on the market since the 2010s, with customer versions of Google Glasses distributed in 2013 and in the following years by Sony and Toshiba, has led to the increasing maturity of AR glasses. More recent AR glasses, providing binocular Micro-LED optical waveguide display, have showcased a technology that may allow users in the near future to experience immersive visual AR technology of quality, similar to what AR helmets already provide. A major advantage of AR glasses, similar to AR helmets, is that users keep the surrounding stable visual references during observation; thus, cybersickness is significantly decreased due to visuo-vestibular incoherencies (see also Chap. 5, Sect. 5.2 Motion and cybersickness). In addition, AR glasses weigh less and are less intrusive, and observers wear them today almost like daily corrective glasses or sunglasses, thus retaining their natural and ecological use.",3,1,3,"{'augmented reality', 'ar', 'vr'}","{'vr': 1, 'augmented reality': 1, 'ar': 1}",

Our approach was validated by comparing it to the solution currently in use by Aptoide, a mobile application store, since no benchmarks are available for this specific task. To further evaluate the proposed model, we asked 1262 users to compare the results achieved by both approaches, also allowing us to build an annotated dataset of similar applications. Results show that the semantic representations are able to capture the context of the applications, with more useful recommendations being presented to users, when compared to Aptoide’s current solution.

It is important to judge if a target instance is from one of the classes shared by the source and target domains.

The knowledge is learnt from the labeled source data, and then leveraged to predict the labels of target domain samples by the first network. The second network specializes in the target domain under the guidance of the first one. We further incorporate an augmented classification head together with semantic-based contrastive regularization into the dedicated network. This will enable the model in capturing information useful for identifying unknown-class instances, as well as identifying the shared classes. The dedicated network in turn guides the cross-domain network via consistency regularization.

There are a variety of facilitation models that support student learning and assessment on clinical placement. As workforce pressures increase globally, innovative approaches to clinical facilitation are required. In the Collaborative Clusters Education Model of clinical facilitation, hospital-employed clinical facilitators work collaboratively within peer groups (clusters) to collectively participate in a process of facilitating student learning and conducting assessment and moderation of student performance. The assessment process in this collaborative clinical facilitation model is not well described. AimTo describe how the assessment of undergraduate nursing students is achieved in the Collaborative Clusters Education Model. DesignA qualitative descriptive approach was employed. MethodsIn March 2021 individual and group interviews were conducted with seven clinical facilitators working in the Collaborative Clusters Education Model in one health service in southeast Queensland, Australia. Content analysis of transcribed interviews was performed. ResultsAssessment was achieved through two processes, situational scoring and moderation. In the process of situational scoring, clinical facilitators balanced the students’ perception of their role in assessment, accounted for the type of experiences available, considered multiple sources of evidence and used the Australian Nursing Standards Assessment Tool. In the process of moderation, clinical facilitators communicated with their cluster colleagues to determine a shared understanding of student history, considered data from multiple evidence sources and collaboratively evaluated the trustworthiness of student performance evaluation decisions. ConclusionsIn the Collaborative Clusters Education Model, the input of multiple assessors, working in a small team, ensured transparency in assessment processes. Furthermore, this transparency in assessment practices normalised on-going moderation, an in-built quality-check and, as such, an innovative component of assessment in the Collaborative Clusters Education Model. As nursing directors and managers seek to ameliorate the impact of nursing workforce pressures, this innovative model of collaborative assessment may serve as a valuable addition to nursing clinical assessment toolkits.

This method uses phase change materials (PCM) as heat storage medium, often augmented with metal foam to optimize heat transfer. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach of altering the container shape to enhance the heat storage effectiveness. LHTES tank with different coning coefficients (C) is designed by reducing the hard-to-melt bottom region. Based on the finite volume, volume averaging, and enthalpy porosity method, the transformation process of a simplified two-dimensional model of the LHTES tank is numerically simulated. Analysis focuses on the evolution of liquid-solid interface, liquid fraction, temperature field, and heat storage performance. The results indicate that the bottom region area enhances the heat storage performance when C < 0.375, whereas for C ≥ 0.375, it hinders heat transfer. When the porosity is 0.93, the newly deformed LHTES tank demonstrates a reduction of up to 6.2% in melting time compared with the basic model. Additionally, it achieves 98% of the basic thermal energy storage. Furthermore, metal foams with varying porosity are analyzed, and a cooperative optimization matching strategy between porosity and shape is obtained. By reducing the porosity to 0.87, the melting time can achieve a 61% reduction at C = 0.125. This study is expected to provide new insights and references for optimizing the design of LHTES devices.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

However, the existing machine learning (ML) models perform poorly. Moreover, existing studies only perform a binary stress assessment, while to develop a more engaging biofeedback-based application, multilevel assessment is necessary. Existing studies annotate and classify a single experience (e.g., watching a VR video) to a single stress level, which again prevents design of dynamic experiences where real-time in-game stress assessment can be utilized. In this article, we report our findings on a new study on VR stress assessment, where three stress levels are assessed. ECG data were collected from nine users experiencing a VR roller coaster. The VR experience was then manually labeled in 10-s segments to three stress levels by three raters. We then propose a novel multimodal deep fusion model utilizing spectrogram and 1-D ECG that can provide a stress prediction from just a 1-s window. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the classical heart-rate variability (HRV)-based ML models (9% increase in accuracy) and baseline deep learning models (2.5% increase in accuracy).

To tackle these issues, we propose a model partitioning-based self-aware collaborative edge inference framework. Specifically, the device can adaptively adjust the local model inference scheme by sensing the available computing and communication resources of surrounding devices. When the inference latency requirement cannot be met by local computation, the model should be partitioned for collaborative computation on other devices to improve the inference efficiency. Furthermore, for two typical IIoT scenarios, i.e., bursting and stacking tasks, the latency-aware and throughput-aware collaborative inference algorithms are designed, respectively. Via jointly optimizing the partition layer and collaborative device selection, the optimal inference efficiency, characterized by minimum inference latency and maximum inference throughput, can be obtained. Finally, the performance of our proposal is validated through extensive simulations and tests conducted on 10 Raspberry Pi 4Bs using popular models. Specifically, in the case of two collaborative devices, our platform reaches up to 92.59% latency reduction for bursting tasks and 16.19× throughput growth for stacking tasks. In addition, the divergence between simulations and tests ranges from 1.64% to 9.56% for bursting tasks and from 3.24% to 11.24% for stacking tasks, which indicates that the theoretical performance analyses are solid. For the general case where the data privacy is not considered and the number of collaborative devices is optimally determined, up to 14.76× throughput speed up and 84.04% latency reduction can be obtained.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

In this paper, the SOH and RUL estimation model for lithium-ion batteries that call the activation function library-long and short-term memory neural network algorithm (CAFL-LSTM) is proposed to achieve accurate estimation of the capacity of lithium-ion batteries in the aging state. This study innovatively established a library of activation functions and called this activation function library according to the conditions, which made the traditional long short term memory (LSTM) neural network converge faster and estimate the relevant parameters of lithium-ion batteries with high accuracy. The CAFL-LSTM takes the three health factors extracted from the easy-to-measure data with high correlation coefficients as the neural network's inputs to estimate the target parameters and was validated using four sets of canonical state data from NASA's publicly available dataset to form an aging model capable of accurately estimating the life of lithium-ion batteries. The validation results show that the SOH estimation accuracy of the CAFL-LSTM neural network can reach 98.4380 %, and it can effectively improve the SOH estimation result of the traditional neural network estimation by at least 8.0000 %. RUL value is large when the 70th cycle is used as the starting point for the prediction of the No.7 battery, but its estimation error is reduced by 28 cycles compared with that of the traditional network.

Combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) based Secure User Recruitment (SUR) protocol, effectively tackles the challenge of recruiting multiple users without prior knowledge and user interactivity while adhering to budget and time limitations. Theoretical analysis confirms lightweight overhead of the PPUR scheme and its multi-class data security.

While wearables collect various information, e.g., physiological and behavioral data of an IoT end-user, to provide different services, market-wearables often have no authentication or have knowledge-based authentications. This limitation brings additional security challenges. However, similar types of data, e.g., heart rate (source: both Wellue and Fitbit), or different types of data, e.g., oxygen saturation values (source: Wellue) and calorie burn (source: Fitbit), obtained from multiple IoT-connected wearables could contain complementary information (due to positional variation of different wearables on different body parts), which can be helpful in uniquely identifying a user. Therefore, in this work, we propose an implicit IoT end-user authentication (mWIoTAuth) approach utilizing data from two market wearables, i.e., Wellue (providing heart rate and oxygen saturation values) and Fitbit (providing heart rate, calorie burn, and step count). From our detailed analysis of a 2-phase study conducted with two separate cohorts of 40 subjects wearing Wellue and Fitbit in their daily life for continuous 8 h, we find that models developed from two wearables have 5%–14% higher accuracy and F1 score compared to the single-wearable models.

This paper investigates multi-user scheduling to meet XR services’ hard-latency constraints. Specifically, we focus on a periodical traffic model, where the latency constraint for transmitting each XR frame is less than the inter-arrival time. We describe the system as a periodic Markov Decision Process (MDP) with the performance metric being the probability of successful transmission within the latency constraint. We then obtain the maximum success probability and the optimal scheduling based on the optimal value function. In the case of homogeneous arrivals, we construct a lower bound of the optimal value function. Based on this, we propose an online multi-user scheduling policy that determines scheduling decisions by solving a series of nonlinear Knapsack Problems (KPs) in polynomial time. Our analysis demonstrates that the scheduling scheme is asymptotically optimal with increasing users. Furthermore, we extend the online scheduling scheme to heterogeneous arrivals and present extensions for practical scenarios with multiple resource blocks, quasi-periodical arrivals, random frame sizes, and time-correlated channel fading.

Computer programming is a domain that can take advantage of the Collaborative Work paradigm and of this technology. However, to be truly effective, groupware systems must provide suitable awareness support, i.e., be capable of informing users of the activity taking place and of the team outcome, so that they can build a setting for their work. The study of awareness mechanisms and their influence on collaborative programming processes is an open research question. In this context, this article contributes an experimental study to evaluate the mechanisms to support coordination, communication, and awareness of COLLECE, a distributed group programming system rich in awareness support. This study brings as a novel approach the combination of subjective and objective information sources, specifically eye tracking techniques, and incorporates a heuristic evaluation of awareness support based on a well-known framework. Thanks to this experiment, we have been able to verify that this blended approach, in which users participate intensively, provides a more comprehensive and deeper assessment of awareness and other coordination and communication mechanisms, and thus a better understanding of how their use can influence the collaborative programming process and outcome (program or piece of software). The study has revealed strengths, weaknesses and opportunities for improvement of the evaluated system, and has yielded concrete results as to which are the most useful awareness components of the user interface not related to the activity supported by the system (programming), these being the traffic lights; the easiest to use, such as the session panel; or the components that impose a greater cognitive load, such as the multi-scrollbar. Regarding the relationship between the supported awareness dimensions and the quality of the collaboration outcome (computer program), the results point to the need to adequately support the What-Artifact dimension, i.e., highlighting in which part of the shared workspace (the source code) the user with floor control is working.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

Currently, the disposal of Ulva prolifera is primarily performed through ship salvage operations. However, humans schedule salvage operations, which makes them subjective and inefficient. Scheduling tasks for ships requires the coordination of available ship resources to different salvage areas, complicating the human decision-making process. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a method that provides decision support for scheduling plans. This study proposes an algorithm called the multi-objective evolutionary non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (MENSGA) for multi-objective, multi-area scenarios based on non-dominated genetic algorithms, multi-agent systems, and evolutionary population dynamics (EPD). MENSGA updates poorly performing solutions in the population using an EPD update operator. This intelligent decision support solution is specifically designed for the emergency scheduling of green tide salvage operations. Additionally, herein, MENSGA is compared with NSGA-II through experimental analysis, demonstrating the superiority of MENSGA. The updating operators in the model are further analysed by discussing different scenarios based on the use of different updating methods, thereby providing a reference for other application scenarios.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

Real-world data including community practices related to surgeon characteristics and outcomes are lacking. ObjectiveTo evaluate the SFR for ureteroscopy and its predictors across diverse surgeons in Michigan. Design, setting, and participantsWe assessed the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC) clinical registry for patients with renal or ureteral stones treated with ureteroscopy between 2016 and 2021 who had postoperative imaging. Outcome measurements and statistical analysisStone free was defined as no fragments on imaging reports within 60 d entered by independent data abstractors. Factors associated with being stone free were examined using logistic regression, including annual surgeon volume. We then assessed variation in surgeon-level SFRs adjusted for risk factors. Results and limitationsWe identified 6487 ureteroscopies from 164 surgeons who treated 2091 (32.2%) renal and 4396 (67.8%) ureteral stones. The overall SFRs were 49.6% (renal) and 72.7% (ureteral). Increasing stone size, lower pole, proximal ureteral location, and multiplicity were associated with not being stone free. Female gender, positive urine culture, use of ureteral access sheath, and postoperative stenting were associated with residual fragments when treating ureteral stones. Adjusted surgeon-level SFRs varied for renal (26.1–72.4%; p < 0.001) and ureteral stones (52.2–90.2%; p < 0.001). Surgeon volume was not a predictor of being stone free for renal stones. Limitations include the lack of imaging in all patients and use of different imaging modalities. ConclusionsThe real-world complete SFR after ureteroscopy is suboptimal with substantial surgeon-level variation. Interventions focused on surgical technique refinement are needed to improve outcomes for patients undergoing ureteroscopy and stone intervention. Patient summaryResults from a diverse group of community practicing and academic center urologists show that for a large number of patients, it is not possible to be completely stone free after ureteroscopy.

However, the adoption of this paradigm shift, particularly in the field of smart factories and production, is still in its infancy, suffering from various issues, such as the lack of high-quality data, data with high-class imbalance, or poor diversity leading to inaccurate AI models.

Additionally, the efficiency of VANETs, concerning network service utility and latency, depends on the relative positioning of these RSUs within the network topology. Most existing RSU deployment approaches deal with a single objective, either enhancing network service utility or minimizing the latency. For instance, some studies suggest deploying RSUs in high-traffic road segments that enhance network service utility but lead to higher latency. Conversely, some suggest deploying the RSUs in low-traffic road segments that minimize the network latency, but there will be low network service utility. Hence, there exists a trade-off between these two conflicting objectives in VANETs, and none of the studies address both objectives simultaneously. To achieve the balance between these two objectives, this paper proposes a Multi-Objective UAV assisted RSU Deployment (MOURD) scheme that leverages the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for VANET efficiency. The MOURD scheme statically places RSUs in high-traffic road segments and dynamically dispatches the UAVs in low-traffic road segments to facilitate seamless network coverage and minimize the overall network latency. The simulation results on the road network of Delhi, India, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MOURD scheme compared to other benchmark RSU & UAV deployment approaches.

Achieving precise spatial tracking over large areas is a critical challenge in XR development. This paper addresses the drift issue, caused by small errors accumulating over time leading to a discrepancy between the real and virtual worlds. Tackling this issue is crucial for co-located XR experiences where virtual and physical elements interact seamlessly. Building upon the locally accurate spatial anchors, we propose a solution that extends this accuracy to larger areas by exploiting an external, drift-corrected tracking method as a ground truth. During the preparation stage, anchors are placed inside the headset and inside the external tracking method simultaneously, yielding 3D-3D correspondences. Both anchor clouds, and thus tracking methods, are aligned using a suitable cloud registration method during the operational stage. Our method enhances user comfort and mobility by leveraging the headset’s built-in tracking capabilities during the operational stage, allowing standalone functionality. Additionally, this method can be used with any XR headset that supports spatial anchors and with any drift-free external tracking method. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the system’s effectiveness in aligning virtual content with the real world and expanding the accurate tracking area.

Herein, the Zr-Y dual metal co-doping engineering and Co/Fe dual metal-organic frameworks cocatalyst layer were employed for modifying hematite photoanode. The novel CoFe-MOF/Zr-Y:Fe2O3 nanoarray composite photoanode exhibits higher PEC activity, the photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs.RHE is increased by 4.7 times than that of the pristine α-Fe2O3. The gain in bulk charge separation efficiency was mainly attributed to the synergistic effect between the two doping ions to improve the electrical conductivity. Wherein, Zr4+ doping endows more free electrons in the bulk α-Fe2O3 and Y3+ introduction causes polaron mobility enhancement. For another, co-doping could reduce the recombination surface state, but form the intermediate surface state to promote hole transfer, thus effectively inhibiting the severe recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. Furthermore, the CoFe-MOF cocatalyst coating with abundant active sites not only expedites the oxygen evolution reaction kinetics process, but also passivates the surface hole trapping state more thoroughly, resulting in efficient interfacial hole transfer and utilization. This work affords a new collaborative role of co-doping and surface modifying effective avenue for adjusting surface state of hematite to release the photoelectrochemical activity.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

These visualizations increase motivation among novice programmers, and also contribute to better conceptual understanding. For effective implementation of an algorithm or program, it is important to understand its flow of execution. The flow of an algorithm is commonly represented pictorially as a control flow graph (CFG) or as an abstract syntax tree (AST). However, existing representations are static in nature. Adding a dynamic aspect to the CFG to represent the flow of a program or an algorithm might ease the conceptual understanding. Integrating this dynamic CFG with augmented reality might also increase motivation among students in viewing and understanding various algorithms and programs. Hence, we present FlowARP, an augmented reality based visualization tool, to demonstrate the flow of programs. As a first step, we have designed FlowARP to support C/C++ programs and evaluated the usefulness of FlowARP through a user study with 44 undergraduate students, based on an amalgamated approach that assess usefulness and user perception. The results indicated that users were able to solve code-snippet based questions in lesser time, using FlowARP.

Due to pervasiveness of ICT's, most of collaboration can be performed through communication media channels such as discussion forums, social networks, etc. The emotive state of the users while they carry out their activity such as collaborative learning at Universities or project work at enterprises and organizations influences very much their performance and can actually determine the final learning or project outcome. Therefore, monitoring the users' emotive states and using that information for providing feedback and scaffolding is crucial. To this end, automated analysis over data collected from communication channels is a useful source. In this paper, we propose an approach to process such collected data in order to classify and assess emotional states of involved users and provide them feedback accordingly to their emotive states. In order to achieve this, a fuzzy approach is used to build the emotive classification system, which is fed with data from ANEW dictionary, whose words are bound to emotional weights and these, in turn, are used to map Fuzzy sets in our proposal.

We investigated airport agility for air cargo hub airports using a structural equation model, particularly at Incheon International Airport (ICN). This study uses 27 variables to evaluate the agility of the air cargo business for a hub airport. We find that digital transformation, flight services, information sharing, and accessibility enhance the agility of air cargo hub airports. The survey shows that air cargo experts perceive ICN airport as having satisfactory agile response capabilities. Agility is essential to resilience, which will deliver a competitive advantage and aid the long-term prosperity of the air cargo business. Airports must collaborate to share, align, and improve their collective resilience to improve the productivity and performance of air cargo hubs. Developing innovative airport models enabled by new technologies, such as digital transformation, increases the efficiency and agility of the airport.

Due to the problem of fuzzy demand caused by user cognitive bias, traditional design methods usually focus on realizing product functions and cannot effectively match user requirements. Therefore, this paper proposes a complex product module division method for user requirements. The method constitutes of three tasks, requirement analysis of module division, design mapping of module division and scheme implementation of module division. Firstly, based on the progressive architecture from initial requirements to precise requirements, the effective user requirements are obtained through similarity recommendation. Secondly, according to the four types of knowledge of function, geometry, physics and design, the design structure matrix is constructed to complete the Requirement-Function-Structure mapping. The improved Fuzzy C-means Algorithm is used to solve the mapping model, and finally a module division scheme that meets the user requirements is obtained.

However, both classification algorithms still use the global features of the image, ignoring the importance of local features in the face images. In this paper, the face images are first mapped onto the CSGT domain, and then the amplitude images are chosen as the sample images. Finally, CRC is used to classify different faces.

Based on a semistructured diagnostic interview, 160 youth with ODD (ages 7–14; 72% male; ethnicity representative of the wider Australian population) were randomized to CPS (n = 81) or PMT (n = 79) for up to 16 weekly sessions. The primary hypothesis was that participants in the CPS group, treated in a community setting, would exhibit significant improvement in ODD, equivalent to that of an evidence-based treatment, PMT. Assessment was conducted at baseline, post-intervention, and at 6-month follow-up, using independently rated semistructured diagnostic interviews, parent ratings of ODD symptoms, and global ratings of severity and improvement. Analyses were conducted with hierarchical growth linear modeling, ANCOVA, and equivalence testing using an intent-to-treat sample. Both treatments demonstrated similar outcomes, with 45–50% of youth in the nonclinical range after treatment, and 67% considered much improved. No differences were found between groups, and group equivalency was shown on the independent clinician and parent-rated measures. Gains were maintained at the 6-month follow-up. In conclusion, CPS works as effectively as the well-established treatment, PMT, for youths with ODD, when implemented in a community-based setting.

OHCA registries make performance comparison across Emergency Medical Services systems possible for benchmarking, hypothesis generation and further research. Changes in OHCA incidence and outcomes provide insights about the effects of secular trends or health services interventions. These registries, therefore, have become a mainstay of OHCA management and research. However, developing and maintaining these registries is challenging.

In this paper, we propose a reconfigurable service provisioning framework based on service function chaining (SFC) for SAGIN. In SFC, the network functions are virtualized and the service data needs to flow through specific network functions in a predefined sequence. The inherent issue is how to plan the service function chains over large-scale heterogeneous networks, subject to the resource limitations of both communication and computation. Specifically, we must jointly consider the virtual network functions (VNFs) embedding and service data routing. We formulate the SFC planning problem as an integer non-linear programming problem, which is NP-hard. Then, a heuristic greedy algorithm is proposed, which concentrates on leveraging different features of aerial and ground nodes and balancing the resource consumptions. Furthermore, a new metric, aggregation ratio (AR) is proposed to elaborate the communication-computation tradeoff. Extensive simulations shows that our proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal performance. We also find that the SAGIN significantly reduces the service blockage probability and improves the efficiency of resource utilization. Finally, a case study on multiple intersection traffic scheduling is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SFC-based service provisioning framework.",1,1,1,{'ar'},{'ar': 1},

The coherence of echoes in the azimuth direction and the sparsity of the DBS image in the Doppler domain are fully exploited; thus, a superresolution DBS imaging framework using aperture-extrapolated sparse representation (SR) is proposed. In this framework, aperture extrapolation based on the autoregressive model is utilized to predict the forward and backward information in the azimuth direction, and SR is exploited to extract the Doppler spectrum information. In addition, the resolution ability with different coherent processing intervals is analyzed.

Twenty-eight individuals with LBP were facilitated to generate mental models, using “fuzzy cognitive maps,” that represented conceptualization of their own LBP and LBP “in general.” “Components” (ie, causes, outcomes and treatments) related to pain, disability and quality of life were proposed, along with the weighted “Connections” between Components. Components were classified into thematic categories. Weighting of Connections were summed for each Component to judge relative importance. Individual models were aggregated into a metamodel. When considering their own condition, participants’ models included 19(SD = 6) Components and 43(18) Connections with greatest weight on “Biomechanical” components.

Based on the CO2 emission data of the three major urban agglomerations in the YREB from 2010 to 2020, this study summarised characteristics of the CO2 emission association structure of the three major urban agglomerations, explored the factors affecting the spatial association of CO2 emissions of in each urban agglomeration, and proposed countermeasures to promote the collaborative CO2 reduction of the urban agglomerations in the YREB accordingly. Results show that the CO2 emissions and correlations of the three urban agglomerations increase year by year, and the CO2 emission correlations have the spatial characteristics of “dense in the east and sparse in the west,” and the network correlation characteristics differ significantly among urban agglomerations. The CO2 emission linkage of the YREB has formed a block division with urban agglomerations as the boundary, and the linkages between urban agglomerations are relatively weak. The status and role of each city in the synergistic emission reduction network are different, and the formation paths and influencing factors of CO2 emission association are different among urban agglomerations; therefore, differentiated synergistic emission reduction policies need to be formulated for each region. The above findings provide realistic support for constructing a synergistic CO2 reduction strategy in a first-before-supporting and differentiated manner.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

Because of the dynamic, interdependent, and temporal nature of reflective thinking, uncovering the reflective thinking process comprehensively via a sophisticated learning analysis approach can help to inform the pedagogical design and learning environment design. In this study, based on the discourse trace data drawn from 40 student teachers in an eight-week course, content analysis, statistical analysis, and epistemic network analysis were adopted to explore student teachers’ reflective thinking process. The results showed that student teachers paid more attention to the content and premise aspects of reflection, but less attention to the process aspect of reflection. In terms of the stage of reflection, student teachers were in a lower stage of reflection and lack of deep reflection. Differences in reflective thinking between the high- and low-score groups were compared, and the result illustrated that in-depth understanding and analysis of learning tasks could be observed in the early stage of collaboration, reflection on the problem-solving process took place in the middle stage of collaboration. Combined with previous experience, timely self-reflection and evaluation in the late stage of collaboration were more conducive to good collaborative performance.

Sharing the human-centric perspective and harmonious human–machine collaboration concepts emphasized by Industry 5.0, the design phase of a collaborative workstation must integrate both psychological and physical risk evaluations to provide a safe and inclusive work environment suitable for a diversified workforce. Accelerating the pre-deployment phase to quickly reconfigure workstation design and assess its impact on workload balancing and task sequencing during the deployment of assembly lines still represents a challenging task considering the available software tools. This research proposes a new mathematical model to accelerate the design of ergonomic human-robot collaborative workstations based on task alternatives and the combined consideration of postural assessment and fatigue analyses for each of them to design an ergo-friendly collaborative environment. Surface electromyography analysis is jointly adopted with postural risk assessment measured with inertial measurement units and developed by a digital ergonomic platform to determine the optimal workplace configuration for tools, equipment, and resources to promote physical well-being while considering station productivity. Experimental tests are performed to investigate arm muscles and postural risk assessment for different configurations of workstation design and collaborative human-robot job progression. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility, and the advantages of the proposed approach compared to existing simulation software to quickly generate and assess alternative scenarios and find a trade-off between ergo-quality levels and system performance.

Unlike other approaches, we wanted to create a program that concentrates on pathology cases directly linked to patients whom students cared for during their clerkship rotation, emphasizing the relevance of pathology diagnosis. Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive from participating students, who report an increased awareness of pathology's importance in patient management and of the significance of interdisciplinary collaboration between pathologists and clinicians.

However, explicit integration of these modeling results into prospective neurosurgical planning is only beginning to evolve. One challenge of employing connectomic models in patient-specific surgical planning is the inherent 3D nature of the results, which can make clinically useful data integration and visualization difficult. MethodsWe developed a holographic stereotactic neurosurgery research tool (HoloSNS) that integrates patient-specific brain models into a group-based visualization environment for interactive surgical planning using connectomic hypotheses. HoloSNS currently runs on the HoloLens 2 platform and it enables remote networking between headsets. This allowed us to perform surgical planning group meetings with study co-investigators distributed across the country. ResultsWe used HoloSNS to plan stereo-EEG and DBS electrode placements for each patient participating in a clinical trial (NCT03437928) that is targeting both the subcallosal cingulate and ventral capsule for the treatment of depression. Each patient model consisted of multiple components of scientific data and anatomical reconstructions of the head and brain (both patient-specific and atlas-based), which far exceed the data integration capabilities of traditional neurosurgical planning workstations. This allowed us to prospectively discuss and evaluate the positioning of the electrodes based on novel connectomic hypotheses. ConclusionsThe 3D nature of the surgical procedure, brain imaging data, and connectomic modeling results all highlighted the utility of employing holographic visualization to support the design of unique clinical experiments to explore brain network modulation with DBS.",1,1,1,{'ar'},{'ar': 1},

However, as the number of users increases rapidly, recommendation efficiency has become the bottleneck of many existing social recommender systems due to the computation and storage of real-valued models. For addressing the efficiency problem, recent researches resolve it by introducing hashing technique into social recommender systems. By mapping real values to discrete values, the computational speed is guaranteed as well as the storage cost is reduced. Nevertheless, these methods suffer from two critical limitations: (1) The inevitable quantization loss brought by hash function decreases recommendation accuracy to a certain extent. (2) The original social relations contain massive noise that may result in sub-optimal accuracy of recommendation without considering the fact that people can only pay attention to a small number of their friends. Therefore, to tackle the above limitations and have a better tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency, in this paper, we propose a novel social recommendation method called Discrete Limited Attentional Collaborative Filtering (DLACF), which models recommendation objective with limited attention as a constrained mix-integer optimization problem. Since the original problem is NP-hard, we further devise a computationally efficient optimization algorithm to learn the binary codes as well as to estimate the best influential friends. Experimental results conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, achieving the averaged improvement of 118.7% and 54.7% compared to state-of-the-art discrete methods.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

Additionally, they offer a plethora of benefits such as medicinal plants, food, and non-timber forest products. However, with the growing global population, the demand for forest resources has escalated, leading to a decline in their abundance. The reduction in forest density has detrimental impacts on global temperatures and raises the likelihood of forest fires. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a Federated Learning framework empowered by the Internet of Things (IoT). The proposed framework integrates with an Intelligent system, leveraging mounted cameras strategically positioned in highly vulnerable areas susceptible to forest fires. This integration enables the timely detection and monitoring of forest fire occurrences and plays its part in avoiding major catastrophes. The proposed framework incorporates the Federated Stochastic Gradient Descent (FedSGD) technique to aggregate the global model in the cloud. The dataset employed in this study comprises two classes: fire and non-fire images. This dataset is distributed among five nodes, allowing each node to independently train the model on their respective devices. Following the local training, the learned parameters are shared with the cloud for aggregation, ensuring a collective and comprehensive global model. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is assessed by comparing its performance metrics with the recent work. The proposed algorithm achieved an accuracy of 99.27 % and stands out by leveraging the concept of collaborative learning. This approach distributes the workload among nodes, relieving the server from excessive burden.

However, how to form strong and effective collaboration is still a great challenge among multiple cities in urban agglomeration. By analysing the multiple ecological risk transmission pathways of the case of Pearl River Delta Urban Agglomeration (PRD) in China, this paper aims at deconstructing the complex structure and connection types in urban agglomeration, as well as exploring the inherent mechanism of ecological risk governance to achieve collaboration. Thus, a new Bayesian network model of ecological risk transmission is developed to visualize the key connection notes of risk transmission process. Testing the impacts of (1) number of collaborative cities, (2) spatial distance factor and (3) risk transmission links, we can find the optimal cooperative risk management strategy by reducing the probability of occurrence of key nodes and intervening on the critical path of the risk transmission process. The results show that (1) The current collaborative governance plan in the PRD is mainly formulated by large cities driving small surrounding cities, which is not an optimal strategy. (2) The management effect of ecological risks in urban agglomerations is not necessarily positively correlated with the number of collaborative cities. There are multiple combinations methods under a certain number of collaborative cities and the effects of ecological risk collaborative governance are different. (3) Collaboration governance of urban agglomeration should be based on the overall planning of urban development, and comprehensively consider collaboration number, spatial distance and association between cities.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

To reduce the overall computational complexity, a central server firstly extracts and decomposes a collaborative task sequence from the automaton corresponding to the collaborative task specification, and allocates the subtasks in the sequence to robots. The robots then synthesize their initial execution strategies based on locally constructed product automatons, which integrate task requirements of the assigned collaborative tasks and their individual task specifications. Further, to reduce robots’ wait time in collaborations, we propose a distributed execution strategy adjusting mechanism to iteratively improve the time efficiency of robots.

10.1016/j.eswa.2023.120090,Spatial-temporal traffic performance collaborative forecast in urban road network based on dynamic factor model,"Many urban road networks today are experiencing increasing congestion that threatens not only transport efficiency but also living environment. To solve these problems, providing proactive knowledge of traffic performance is of significant importance. However, due to the inherent uncertainties of the signalized urban road network, it is a challenging work and some gaps still exist. First, the existing approaches are usually limited to a single location or region. Second, traffic flow parameters such as volume are used as a proxy of traffic state. Aiming to fill these gaps, this study developed a dynamic factor model-based approach to forecast the multi-step network traffic states of a group of regions in urban road network collaboratively. The novel model decomposes a set of traffic state time series into two orthogonal components: the common latent factor and the idiosyncratic disturbance. The common latent factor drives the co-movement dynamics of network traffic states, while the idiosyncratic disturbance captures the region-specific distinctions of traffic states in different regions. By extracting the principal variations of traffic states in a group of regions, the proposed model reduces the dimensionality of the traffic state variable from high-dimensional original space to low-dimensional latent factor space. By means of the common latent factor and its evolution over time, spatial–temporal correlations of traffic states in different regions and different time slots are seamlessly incorporated. The proposed model exhibits four distinct advantages, (1) it collaboratively produces forecasts for a group of regions; (2) it considers both co-movement dynamics and region-specific distinctions of traffic state; (3) the model incorporates both spatial and temporal correlations seamlessly, and (4) it reduces dimensionality from a network-wide high-dimensional space to a low-dimensional latent factors space. The proposed model is applied to the real urban road network in Shanghai, China, based on the large-scale traffic performance index data released by the Shanghai Transportation Big Data Joint Innovation Laboratory. Empirical results from extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed dynamic factor model provides a promising approach for multi-step network traffic state forecast in urban road network, and outperforms the competing models considered in this study.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

However, there are certain tasks like soft fruit harvesting, where human skills are still required. In this case, the robot’s job is to cooperate/collaborate with human workers to alleviate their physical workload and improve harvesting efficiency. To accomplish that in a safe and reliable way, the robot should incorporate a safety system whose main goal is to reduce the risk of harming human co-workers during close human–robot interaction (HRI). In this context, this paper presents a theoretical study, addressing the safety risks of using collaborative robots in agricultural scenarios, especially in HRI situations when the robot’s safety system is not completely reliable and a component may fail. The agricultural scenarios discussed in this paper include automatic harvesting, logistics operations, crop monitoring, and plant treatment using UV-C light. A human injury assessment is conducted based on converting the HRI in each agricultural scenario into a formal mathematical representation. This representation is later implemented in a probabilistic model-checking tool. We then use this tool to perform a sensitivity analysis that allows us to determine the probability that a human may get injured according to the occurrence of failures in the robot’s safety or perception systems. Results of the sensitivity analysis show that an agricultural robot with a robust human perception system can still harm people if they are not well-trained to interact with the robot for certain scenarios. This illustrates how the probabilistic modeling methodology presented in this work can be used by safety engineers as a guideline to construct their own HRI models and then use the results of the model-checking to enhance the safety and reliability of their robot’s safety system architectures and on-site safety policies.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

The information on wrench can then be used to detect and control interactions for cooperative tasks between humans and robots.

10.1016/j.compind.2024.104112,Enabling Building Information Model-driven human-robot collaborative construction workflows with closed-loop digital twins,"The introduction of assistive construction robots can significantly alleviate physical demands on construction workers while enhancing both the productivity and safety of construction projects. Leveraging a Building Information Model (BIM) offers a natural and promising approach to driving robotic construction workflows. However, because of uncertainties inherent in construction sites, such as discrepancies between the as-designed and as-built components, robots cannot solely rely on a BIM to plan and perform field construction work. Human workers are adept at improvising alternative plans with their creativity and experience and thus can assist robots in overcoming uncertainties and performing construction work successfully. In such scenarios, it is critical to continuously update the BIM as work processes unfold so that it includes as-built information for the ensuing construction and maintenance tasks. This research introduces an interactive closed-loop digital twin framework that integrates a BIM into human-robot collaborative construction workflows. The robot’s functions are primarily driven by the BIM, but it adaptively adjusts its plans based on actual site conditions, while the human co-worker oversees and supervises the process. When necessary, the human co-worker intervenes in the robot’s plan by changing the task sequence or workspace geometry or requesting a new motion plan to help the robot overcome the encountered uncertainties. A drywall installation case study is conducted to verify the proposed workflow. In addition, experiments are carried out to evaluate the system performance using an industrial robotic arm in a research laboratory setting that mimics a construction site and in the Gazebo simulation. Integrating the flexibility of human workers and the autonomy and accuracy afforded by the BIM, the proposed framework offers significant promise of increasing the robustness of construction robots in the performance of field construction work.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

Approaching the design of XR environments from the perspective of information architecture, the paper stipulates that the naturality commonly associated with a sense of presence in XR space cannot be achieved simply through the design or redesign of the visual interface layer, but rather requires a structural approach that leverages human embodiment and spatial thought. The paper tracks this conversation from interface to architecture by anchoring it to Bates’ seminal work on information seeking strategies as exaptation and on her seminal intuition of the role that the environment plays in supporting human information needs; to Horan’s definition of physical and digital space as elements in a continuum in which the ongoing expansion of digital is transforming the physical environment; to Benyon’s conceptualization of blended space as the novel space emerging from the intimate commingling of digital with physical; and to Resmini and Rosati’s heuristic information architecture principles for the design of digital/physical experiences. The paper then describes important structural challenges in the design of XR environments, illustrates the relevance of the framing introduced here by means of a brief case study, and concludes by offering a discussion and preliminary conclusions.",2,1,2,"{'xr', 'ar'}","{'ar': 1, 'xr': 1}",

Data contributors, model contributors, GIS developers, and business experts collaboratively build a spatial decision support system (SDSS) that integrates various resources and knowledge. When disaster strikes, responders collaboratively perform emergency tasks to deliver the right information to the right person at the right time by leveraging the SDSS.

Most existing studies exploit user trajectories or check-ins of Point-Of-Interests (POIs) to predict friendships based on geographic homophily. However, the dynamics of social relationships are left insufficiently considered in modeling user preferences. In this paper, we explore how geographical and social preferences influence each other in a dynamic manner. Specifically, we propose a Meta-path aware Dynamic Graph with Subgraph Inference, named MDyGSI, which models the evolution of user preferences with time-phased sequences of POIs and social relationships for friend recommendation in LBSNs. In each time step of the evolution, geographical and social preferences are modeled through behavior-specific meta-paths in a dynamic heterogeneous graph. The formations of different meta-paths are facilitate by each other to explore mutual influences of dual preferences. To keep the dynamics of social relationships aligned with check-in history, reliable User-User connections are sampled from social graphs based on geographical collaborative filtering in each step, which also avoids noisy social interactions. Furthermore, the dual preferences are concatenated with evolutionary weights measured by a Gated Recurrent Unit for final recommendation. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show significant improvements in MDyGSI over the state-of-the-art methods.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

This paper investigates humans’ behaviors and perceived experiences while interacting with cognitive and physical assistance systems. To enable decisions about the combined use of more than one assistance system within a manufacturing process, comprehensive and comparable knowledge about the impact of applications on productivity and human factors is needed. A multidimensional evaluation model with a mixed-methods approach was developed and applied in a user study. In 300 run-throughs in six different scenarios with skilled workers and students, a questionnaire on human factors was completed after finishing the task. Furthermore, productivity and quality were measured during the study. A comparison between skilled workers and students demonstrated that the usability score of all assistance systems was rated higher among the students. The students rated the ergonomics aspects better for five out of six scenarios. Results show higher compatibility with values and experiences in all investigated combinations for skilled workers than for students. Considering the collected data among the skilled workers, the overall compatibility with experience and values of multi-assistance system scenarios was more positive than in the single-assistance system scenarios.

10.1016/j.compbiomed.2024.108369,Global attention based GNN with Bayesian collaborative learning for glomerular lesion recognition,"Background:Glomerular lesions reflect the onset and progression of renal disease. Pathological diagnoses are widely regarded as the definitive method for recognizing these lesions, as the deviations in histopathological structures closely correlate with impairments in renal function. Methods:Deep learning plays a crucial role in streamlining the laborious, challenging, and subjective task of recognizing glomerular lesions by pathologists. However, the current methods treat pathology images as data in regular Euclidean space, limiting their ability to efficiently represent the complex local features and global connections. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN) that utilizes global attention pooling (GAP) to more effectively extract high-level semantic features from glomerular images. The model incorporates Bayesian collaborative learning (BCL), enhancing node feature fine-tuning and fusion during training. In addition, this paper adds a soft classification head to mitigate the semantic ambiguity associated with a purely hard classification. Results:This paper conducted extensive experiments on four glomerular datasets, comprising a total of 491 whole slide images (WSIs) and 9030 images.

Thermally conductive phase change composites play a vital role by efficiently conducting heat and utilizing matrix phase change for heat storage. Conventional materials encounter difficulties such as low thermal conductivity, restricted heat storage density, and vulnerability to leakage. This study presents a novel method combining electrospinning and ice-templating method to produce aerogel microspheres with sea urchin-like structures, resolving mentioned issues. The microspheres exhibit a radial microstructure and controllable size, serving as efficient fillers for the easy production of high-performance phase change materials. The microspheres are able to create an efficient interlocking mechanism with surface spike structures, forming a continuous thermal conduction and spatially confined network in the composite material. At a filler content of 43.9 vol%, the thermal conductivity of the Al aerogel microsphere/paraffin composite reaches a peak value of 3.2 W/mK, accompanied by a contact thermal resistance of 1.2 × 10−6 Km2/W.

In this work, we investigate a CSS in a fully-distributed environment where all secondary users (SUs) are equipped with directional antennas and make decisions based solely on their local knowledge without information sharing between SUs. First, we establish a stochastic sequential optimization problem, which is an NP-hard, that maximizes the SU’s detection accuracy by the dynamic and optimal control of the energy sensing/detection threshold. It can enable SUs to select an available channel and sector without causing interference to the primary network. To address it in a distributed environment, the problem is transformed into a decentralized partially observed Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) problem. Second, in order to determine the best control for the Dec-POMDP in a practical environment without any prior knowledge of state–action transition probabilities, we develop a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-based algorithm, which is referred to as MA-DCSS. This algorithm adopts the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture. Third, we analyzed its computational complexity and showed the proposed approach’s scalability by the polynomial computational complexity, in terms of the number of channels, sectors, and SUs.

The World Health Organization warns that by 2030 road traffic accidents will be the fifth leading cause of death in the world. The rapid development of virtual reality (VR) technology in recent years has made it possible to create simulators of varying complexity and cost to support the process of simulation, training, and adaptation of drivers. One of the important problems when driving is the need to switch from left-hand drive to right-hand drive or vice versa. The number of countries and territories with vehicle traffic in the left lane is over 70, and in the remaining over 115 countries, vehicle traffic is in the right lane. Millions of people travel between left-hand and right-hand drive countries and experience difficulties from the different standard, which creates conditions for road transport accidents. This paper examines the creation of a left-hand and right-hand drive virtual reality training system to assist in the adaptation process for drivers when they need to drive in reverse to what they have been using up until now.

Mobile augmented reality is a promising solution along this path that enables the overlap of digital and real-world information in an engaging and efficient manner.

A user evaluation was conducted aiming to measure the users’ engagement, learning, and experience using the installation. The encouraging results led to a follow-up study about the impact of the physical scale model on the experience. Two variations of the experience have been studied, one with a physical scale model and one with a digital-only version in a between-subject design.

This 3D network combines extensive coverage of satellite communications, adaptability of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications, reliability of terrestrial communications, and the necessity for maritime communications. These networks generate enormous amounts of data, and training machine learning (ML) models on this data will have a significant impact on industry. At the same time, the availability of such data poses numerous security threats, which can be overcome using Federated Learning (FL). Decentralized training in FL can provide a universal model from local data generated by 3D networks. However, most existing FL frameworks have a centralized server, which questions credibility, single-point failure, and global confidence. To solve these problems, industrial blockchain technology has received a lot of attention by replacing centralized servers in traditional FL, which offers a promising approach to address key issues like data privacy and security. In a blockchain-based system, digital signatures are a core component for ensuring data integrity and system security, however, private key disclosure can pose significant risks. Security can be enhanced by using threshold signatures which provide a more reliable foundation for FL by storing keys in multiple nodes and requiring multiple nodes to collaborate to generate signatures. In this paper, we propose a Threshold signing scheme for ISO/IEC Digital Signature Standards (TDSS) in an industrial blockchain. The TDSS scheme helps FL to achieve truly distributed decentralization for unified space-air-ground-sea model training. The TDSS scheme exploits the SM-2 digital signature algorithm in the ISO/IEC standard when t out of n nodes in an industrial blockchain interact with each other to calculate the signature. The experimental results and analysis show that the TDSS scheme has provable security and efficient against security attacks, which can be applied to large-scale threshold signing scenarios.",1,1,1,{'ar'},{'ar': 1},

/doi/10.1145/3652920.3652933,Social Simon Effect inVirtualReality: Investigating the Impact of Co-actor Avatar's Visual Representation,"When engaging in joint actions in the real world, each individual achieves unconscious coordination with the other by automatically activating representations of the other’s behavior in the motor system. It has been investigated by examining the Social Simon Effect (SSE), which is a spatial stimulus–response interference induced by the presence and active engagement of a co-actor in a joint single response go/nogo task (the joint Simon task). On the other hand, collaborative co-actors are not always perceived in the same way between the real world and virtual reality (VR) as the visual representation of the avatar is thought to affect the perception of others’ presence and actions. In order to obtain design guidelines for a virtual environment (VE) that facilitates collaboration between users, this study looked into (1) whether SSE can occur during joint actions of avatars in a VE; and (2) how the visual representation of the co-actor’s avatar affects SSE; through the joint Simon task performed by two adjacent avatars. The results showed that SSE was induced when the co-actor’s avatar was displayed in full-body or was entirely transparent, but the SSE was weak when only the two hands were visible. These results suggested that participants perceived the full-body avatar as the socially engaged co-actor, representing its motions into their own motor planning. The same phenomenon occurred when the whole body of the co-actor was not visible, which could be attributed to the visibility of response actions and their consequential effects facilitated the occurrence of SSE. In contrast, the hand avatar, with its non-human-like appearance and seeming function independently of the entire body, inhibited the action co-representation process because it might be perceived as an unintentional artificial agent.",4,2,4,"{'ar', 'vr', 'collaborative', 'virtual reality'}","{'vr': 1, 'virtual reality': 1, 'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",
10.1109/TMECH.2016.2624263,High-Force Display Capability and Wide Workspace With a Novel Haptic Interface,"We present a novel haptic interface, named VirtuaPower, having a high-force display capability (FDC) and a wide workspace with a six-degree-of-freedom position measurement and FDC. The overall mechanism of VirtuaPower is designed based on a parallel pair of five-bar mechanisms supporting the end-platform. This novel mechanism enhances the high-FDC and overcomes the problem of small-size workspace, which are the pros and cons of parallel mechanisms, respectively. First, we present the conceptual design and prototype of VirtuaPower. Then, we formulate the forward kinematic and the constraint and space Jacobian. Using these formulations, we analyze two types of workspaces and FDC. In both analyses, VirtuaPower shows remarkable performances, especially in terms of its FDC, compared to other haptic interfaces having an equivalent size. In addition, we validate the static, step, and frequency responses of the force-display performance by performing experiments using the test bench of fixed end setup with a six-dimensional force/torque sensor. Finally, we evaluate the suitability of VirtuaPower as a haptic interface by realizing two types of virtual sphere walls and a virtual reality environment.",2,1,2,"{'ar', 'virtual reality'}","{'virtual reality': 1, 'ar': 1}",

The core idea is to translate the motion of pedaling on a mini exercise bike to a corresponding walking animation of a virtual avatar while providing audio-based tactile feedback on virtual ground contacts. We conducted an experiment to evaluate the LUI and our novel anchor-turning rotation control method regarding task performance, spatial cognition, VR sickness, sense of presence, usability and comfort in a path-integration task. The results show that VR Strider has a significant positive effect on the participants' angular and distance estimation, sense of presence and feeling of comfort compared to other established locomotion techniques, such as teleportation and joystick-based navigation. A confirmatory study further indicates the necessity of synchronized avatar animations for virtual vehicles that rely on pedalling.",3,1,3,"{'ar', 'vr', 'virtual reality'}","{'vr': 1, 'virtual reality': 1, 'ar': 1}",

This paper discusses a model which is able to render in real-time the contact force/torque occurring in peg-in-hole operations in an interactive virtual reality environment. Results show that our implementation of haptic rendering can be well maintained at the required 1 KHz for a necessary fidelity without separating it from the time consuming collision detection. It is noticed that the hand's grasping posture on the tool should be an explicit parameter in the force/torque output function since it affects the feedback perception.,2,1,2,"{'ar', 'virtual reality'}","{'virtual reality': 1, 'ar': 1}",

To address this challenge, a composite strengthening and toughening strategy was proposed by the simultaneous addition of WC and La2O3. And a collaborative improvement of strength and ductility is achieved over the as-sintered Mo-WC-La2O3, exhibiting a total elongation (TE) of 33.63% and an ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 611.33 MPa, about 50.27% and 24.76% larger than those of pure Mo, respectively. Furthermore, the corresponding microstructural features and tensile fracture behavior were also discussed to explore the improvement mechanism. And it is found that the enhancement should be attributed to the high relative density, grain refinement, generated substructures and secondary phase particle refinement. Moreover, the additional toughening mechanisms of crack deflection, particles pull-out and crack halt can also prevent crack extension, which helps to give full play to the potential ductility of Mo composites. This work provides a new pathway for manufacturing advanced Mo-based products with excellent strength-ductility balance.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",
10.1016/j.jii.2023.100531,Cloud–edge collaborative control for roaster furnace: A hybrid first-principles and data-driven method,"Temperature stability control of the roaster furnace is an important yet challenging problem due to the fluctuation of feed compositions. To solve this problem, a first-principles and data-driven cloud–edge collaborative control (CECC) method is proposed. Specifically, through first-principles analysis, the influencing factors of temperature fluctuation are determined, and then the feed fluctuation is divided into two parts: the batch difference (BD) caused by changes in production objectives or process conditions, and the random fluctuation (RF) caused by uncertain factors of component content or ore source mixing process. For the problem of BD, a first-principles model of the roasting process is established by integrating multisource data in the cloud. Through timely response to the batch differences, the appropriate feed rate is sent to the edge controller to address the temperature unstable problem induced by the sudden component batch changes. For the problem of RF, a fuzzy controller based on trend analysis is adopted at the edge to fine-tune the feed rate to further reduce the negative impact of component fluctuation on the temperature. Accordingly, the proposed CECC method can realize stable control of the roaster furnace temperature synergistically. Both the numerical simulation experiment and hardware-in-the-loop platform experiment results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",
10.1016/j.vacuum.2023.112150,Collaborative activation mechanism in double transition metal MXenes anode: An effective method to improve the capacitance of sodium ion battery,"Through theoretical calculations, it is found that anode materials with double transition metal terminals (VNbC, VTaC, and NbTaC) exhibit better performance than their single metallic phases. Compared with single metal phase, the maximum sodium adsorption capacities of VNbC, VTaC, and NbTaC increased by 75%, 37.5%, and 75%, respectively. In particular, the metal VNbC VTaC and NbTaC anodes not only have high theoretical capacitances of 601.85, 302.20 and 328.13 mAhg−1, but also have original low migration barriers with sodium atoms. Bader charge indicates that the large capacities originate from the difference in metal electronegativity, and this difference leads to a reduction in the charge contribution of transition metals in materials and the accumulation of excess electrons on the surface. These extra accumulated electrons can be transferred to the outside to form an additional negative electron cloud that stabilizes the formation of the second layer of sodium adsorption, and leading to a large theoretical capacitance. We named this phenomenon the “Collaborative Activation” mechanism of double transition metal MXenes. These interesting results show that MXene anodes composed of different metal terminals are powerful methods to improve anode performance. Therefore, it provides a powerful reference for the research of MXenes.",2,2,2,"{'ar', 'collaborative'}","{'ar': 1, 'collaborative': 1}",

Technology-enabled learning environments allow students to acquire knowledge effectively because traditional teaching models can be complemented with new teaching strategies, thus improving content comprehension and student motivation. Learning English as a second language plays an important role worldwide, as it is known as a global communication medium that has now integrated different technological platforms to allow students to achieve their learning objectives comprehensively and interactively. One of the technologies used is virtual reality, which allows partial or total immersion in a digital simulation, thus enabling the learning process through a three-dimensional simulation of organized information and allowing direct interaction with the user. In the present research an immersive virtual reality environment was developed to learn English, Unity and Vuforia were used for the design of the environment, and HTC VIVE PRO glasses were used as hardware. A 3D virtual classroom is presented with audiovisual resources, animations, and avatars so that students can reinforce what they have learned in class by carrying out the proposed exercises. The results of the validation with experts showed 100% acceptance of the use of virtual reality as a complement to the English teaching process since the tool can be used as a reinforcement that has a positive impact on student learning. Meanwhile, in the students’ survey, 95% of acceptance in the use of the virtual environment was obtained because it is user-friendly and motivates learning, for this reason, they would like to continue using it in other areas of their major.",2,1,2,"{'ar', 'virtual reality'}","{'virtual reality': 1, 'ar': 1}",

This approach significantly reduces the latency associated with cloud processing, thereby enhancing the quality of service. In this paper, we propose a system in which a cellular network, comprising multiple users, interacts with both cloud and edge servers to process service requests. The system assumes non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for user access to the radio spectrum. We model the interactions between users and servers using queuing theory, aiming to minimize the total energy consumption of users, service delivery time, and overall network operation costs. The problem is mathematically formulated as a multi-objective, bounded non-convex optimization problem. The Structural Correspondence Analysis (SCA) method is employed to obtain the global optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model reduces energy consumption, delay, and network costs by approximately 50%, under the given assumptions.",1,1,1,{'ar'},{'ar': 1},
